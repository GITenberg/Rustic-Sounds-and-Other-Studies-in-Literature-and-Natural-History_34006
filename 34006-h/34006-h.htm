RUSTIC SOUNDS</h2>
<p>Sounds are to me more reminiscent than sights; they bring back
the sensations of childhood, and indeed all memories of my past
life, in a way more touching and clear than what is seen.&nbsp;
Wendell Holmes claims the sense of smell as most closely
associated with memory; for me, as I say, it is that of
hearing.</p>
<p>In this paper I shall wander in imagination through the
different seasons in the home of my youth, and let the recalled
rustic sounds lead where they will.</p>
<p>To children there is something impressive and almost sacred in
the changes of the seasons, in the onset of winter, or the clear
approach of spring.&nbsp; The first of these changes was heralded
for me by the appearance of puddles frozen to a shining white;
mysterious because the frost had drunk them dry in roofing them
with ice, and especially delightful in the sharp crackling sound
they gave when trodden on.&nbsp; This was the noise of the
beginning of winter.&nbsp; Another winter memory is the humming
whistle of the boys&rsquo; feet as they slid on the village pond,
a remembrance that recalls my envious admiration of their heavily
nailed boots, giving them an advantage in pace and a more noble
style of sliding.</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Another familiar sound was the wicked groaning crack that
ran round the solitary pond on which we skated, as it unwillingly
settled down to bear us on its surface.&nbsp; It had a threat in
it, and reminded us how helpless we were, that the pond-spirit
was our master and had our lives in its grip.</p>
<p>Another winter note was the hooting of invisible owls, boldly
calling to each other from one moonlit tree to another.&nbsp; In
the spring there was the querulous sound of the lambs, staggering
half fledged in the cold fields among the half-eaten turnips
beside their dirty yellow mothers.&nbsp; Not the sheep of the
Dresden shepherdess, but rather of the old man in <i>As You Like
It</i>, who warns Rosalind that shepherding has its ugly
side.&nbsp; Yet it had something prophetic of more genial
days.</p>

</a>As the sap began to rise in the trees my thoughts lightly
turned to the making of whistles.&nbsp; I was taught the mystery
by a labourer in my father&rsquo;s employ and never departed from
his method.&nbsp; The first thing was to cut a branch of some
likely tree, a horse-chestnut for choice, severing it by an
oblique cut, removing a ring of bark R and notching it at
N.&nbsp; The bark had then to be removed in one piece so as to
make the tube of the whistle.&nbsp; The first thing was to suck
the bark and thoroughly wet it&mdash;a process I now believe to
have been entirely useless.&nbsp; The bark was next hammered <!--
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>all
over with the haft of the knife, which was held by the
blade.&nbsp; Then when the inner layer of the bark was well
bruised, it could be removed in one piece.&nbsp; To effect this I
was taught to hold it in my handkerchief, and after a twist or
two, a delicious yielding was experienced and the bark slipped
off.&nbsp; The shiny white stick which remained in the other hand
had to be cut in half, shaved in a particular way and again
fitted into its bark tube.&nbsp; Then came the exciting
moment,&mdash;would the thing whistle?&nbsp; The joy was short
lived, and the whistles soon dried and shrank and ceased to
satisfy the artist.&nbsp; But it was always possible to make a
new one.</p>
<p>Since the above description was written, there has appeared in
<i>The Times</i> Literary Supplement (February 22, 1917, p. 90) a
notice of the poems of a Canadian writer <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> from which the reviewer quotes the
following beautiful lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So in the shadow by the nimble flood,<br />
 He made her whistles of the willow wood, <br />
 Flutes of one note with mellow slender tone; <br />
 (A robin piping in the dark alone).<br />
 Lively the pleasure was the wand to bruise, <br />
 And notch the light rod for its lyric use, <br />
 Until the stem gave up its slender sheath,<br />
 And showed the white and glistening wood beneath.<br />
 And when the ground was covered with light chips, <br />
 Grey leaves and green, and twigs and tender slips,&rdquo; . .
.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>This could only have been written by one perfectly
familiar with the art of whistle-making.&nbsp; But it seems to
have been misunderstood by the reviewer, who says that he
&ldquo;once came upon one of these small &AElig;olian harps in a
wooded isle in the &lsquo;Land of Afternoon,&rsquo;&rdquo; . . .
and decided &ldquo;that it was a work of superstition by Indian
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an &AElig;olian harp is a stringed
instrument sounded by the wind, and a whistle belongs to the very
distinct class of musical things sounded by human breath, I can
only suppose that the reviewer has misunderstood the poem.</p>
<p>I cannot leave the Canadian poet without a reference to the
beautiful line, (&ldquo;A robin piping in the dark
alone.&rdquo;)&nbsp; A Canadian robin must surely make a song
like ours, who seems also to sing in parenthesis.</p>
<p>The other form of rustic pipe that pleased me was a sort of
oboe made from a dandelion stalk by squeezing it at one
end.&nbsp; It had a rough nasal note, which could be controlled
by holes cut in the stalk and stopped with the fingers.&nbsp;
This again was but brief satisfaction, for the two halves of the
reed soon curled outwards and ceased to speak.&nbsp; In later
life this curling outwards was made use of in my work in the
physiology of plants.&nbsp; I like to remember that my primeval
oboe gave me the idea.</p>
<p>The village boys made &lsquo;musics&rsquo; by fixing strips of
laurel leaf into a split stick, and blowing violently into them,
which set the leaf vibrating and made a coarse scream, but this
instrument we despised, and I think rightly, for it had none of
the <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>pleasant tone of the whistle, nor was there any art in
the making of it.</p>
<p>A primeval musical instrument called the &lsquo;Whit
horn&rsquo; I have seen in the possession of the late Mr.
Taphouse, of Oxford.&nbsp; It is a conical tube of bark held
together with thorns and sounded by means of a rough oboe-reed
made of bark; there were no finger-holes, and is said to have
yielded a harsh shriek on one note.&nbsp; It was, I think, played
on May 1st, or else at Whitsuntide.&nbsp; It is to Mr. Taphouse
that I owe my introduction to the pipe and tabor which form the
subject of a paper in this volume.&nbsp; The pipe is shrill in
its upper register, but this is no great fault in an instrument
meant to be played out of doors: the same fault is to be found
with the flageolet, and the penny whistle.&nbsp; But the last
named instrument is reminiscent of a man playing outside a London
public-house, and we know from the story of the perfidious
Sergeant in <i>The Wrong Box</i> to what lengths it may lead us.
<a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>The most truly rustic instrument (and here I mean an
instrument of polite life&mdash;an orchestral instrument) is
undoubtedly the oboe.&nbsp; The bassoon runs it hard, but has a
touch of comedy and a stronger flavour of necromancy, while the
oboe is quite good and simple in nature and is excessively in
earnest; it seems to have in it the ghost of a sunburnt boy
playing to himself under a tree, in a ragged shirt unbuttoned at
the throat, a boy created by Velasquez.&nbsp; To <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>hear an oboe
actually played as a rustic instrument one must go to Brittany,
where it accompanies the national bagpipe or
&lsquo;biniou.&rsquo;&nbsp; To a reed-instrument player it was
painful to see the oboist bite a bit off his reed when the tone
was not to his liking!</p>
<p>From this digression, originating in the whistle cut from a
horse-chestnut bough, I return to some less artificial
sounds.&nbsp; I must say a word about the song of birds, but my
knowledge of the subject is but small.&nbsp; The most obvious of
spring-time sounds is the voice of the cuckoo.&nbsp; I confess to
liking the muttering chuckle which, in an unscientific mood, I
have supposed to mean that an egg has successfully been laid in a
hedge-sparrow&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; But the cuckoo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;word in a minor third&rdquo; is always delightful.&nbsp;
The bird is neither more nor less of a foreigner than a
willow-wren, yet he has, in comparison to the wren&rsquo;s
subdued chromatic warble, a song so self-assertive, and a tone so
unlike our other birds, that one feels him an obvious exotic, a
foreigner of so glorious and dashing a nature that one is
grateful to him for singing among flat ploughed lands and
monotonous hedges.&nbsp; I fancy the Welsh proverb, &ldquo;Who
would have thought the cuckoo would sing on the turf-heaps of the
mountains,&rdquo; is a poetic reflexion of this thought.</p>
<p>Of the nightingale I have nothing to say, except to put on
record a true remark of Sir Charles Stanford&rsquo;s, viz., that
he sings in a syncopated rhythm.&nbsp; But, though I lived in a
nightingale land, it is another bird that most clearly brings
back to me the country of my boyhood, I mean the <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>night-jar.&nbsp; He has something of antique mystery
which I do not find in the nightingale, as he purrs on his only
note through the warm night.&nbsp; There is something unknown and
prim&aelig;val and vaguely threatening in his relentless
simplicity.&nbsp; Can it be that I inherit from a stone-age
ancestor both the fear and love of the bull-roarer?</p>
<p>Another bird that moves one in a very different way is the
robin, of whom it is hard to say whether he has more of tears or
smiles in his recitative.&nbsp; In comparison to the night-jar he
seems like a civilised human soul who has quite modern sorrows,
and has half forgotten them in quiet contentment with the autumn
sunshine.&nbsp; The blackbird has a tinge of the robin&rsquo;s
sentiment, but it is over-borne by the glory of his song as a
whole, which is pure gold, like his beak.</p>
<p>The chaffinch is not an interesting person, and he is so
numerous that one soon becomes weary of him and his song.&nbsp;
Let us hope that he expresses his real nature in the building of
his pretty nest rather than in song.&nbsp; This must, I think,
often happen, and to take an example from human builders, it is
not inconceivable that the architect of St. John&rsquo;s College
Chapel, Cambridge, may have sung delightfully.&nbsp; But there
are limits to one&rsquo;s faith, and personally I cannot imagine
the desecrator of Pembroke College in the same injured town of
Cambridge practising any art in a way that would please me.</p>
<p>To return to birds&mdash;the greenfinch is a pleasant singer,
or perhaps a conversationalist.&nbsp; I am never tired of hearing
him repeat the word &ldquo;Squeese&rdquo; as <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>he sits hidden
in the heavy shade of the summer elms.&nbsp; His twinkling
bell-note with its contented simplicity is also attractive.&nbsp;
His cousin, the bunting, makes remarks not unlike those of the
greenfinch; and he appears to address them by preference to the
travellers on dusty high roads, where he passes much of his time
sitting on telegraph wires.&nbsp; The anchorite yellow-hammer
persistently declining cheese with his bread is always
pleasant.&nbsp; Professor Newton used to say that the spring
begins with the yellow-hammer&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; According to
Blomefield&rsquo;s <i>Calendar </i><a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a> the average date in
Cambridgeshire is February 16, but he has been known to sing on
January 30&mdash;rather a wintry beginning for spring.&nbsp; I
have never made up my mind as to what the kitty-wren says or
sings.&nbsp; He is always in a desperate hurry to get through his
piece, as if he were afraid of lagging behind the beat of some
invisible conductor.&nbsp; In consequence of this there is a want
of restraint, and a style that suggests a shy child gabbling a
show bit of poetry.&nbsp; But I repent these words for I love the
kitty-wren.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of other bird-sounds which are pleasant
to hear as their turn comes round, for instance, the complaint of
the wryneck, the &ldquo;cuckoo&rsquo;s mate,&rdquo; who seems to
me to be querulously expressing his dislike to my garden, which
he tries year after year and deserts after a day or two.</p>
<p>I have never heard that contented bird the <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>quail, who
should be a wholesome lesson to all wrynecks.&nbsp; I should like
to hear him as Schubert has him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sitzend im Gr&uuml;nen<br />
Mit Halmen umh&uuml;llt,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and singing &ldquo;Lobe Gott&rdquo; all day in the rhythm with
which the oboe praises God in the Pastoral Symphony.</p>
<p>Another bird, whom I take for a contented fellow, is the green
woodpecker, for he goes through life laughing, but I am not quite
sure that I should like his taste in jokes.&nbsp; He is always
associated in my mind with a passage in a letter of my
father&rsquo;s: &ldquo;At last I fell fast asleep on the grass,
and awoke with a chorus of birds singing around me; and squirrels
running up the trees, and some woodpeckers laughing, and it was
as pleasant and rural a scene as ever I saw, and I did not care
one penny how any of the beasts or birds had been formed.&rdquo;
<a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>There are many noises rather than notes which are most
pleasant to hear.&nbsp; The invisible industrious corncrake,
whose persistent cry comes from nowhere and everywhere at
once.&nbsp; The harsh warning of the jay who seems to say
&ldquo;Man! man!&rdquo; as he skulks off when his wood is
invaded.&nbsp; The rough noise of the ox-eye sharpening his
little saw, and many others.</p>
<p>Then I must not forget the noise of birds in flocks, ranging
from the familiar wrangle of sparrows noisily going to roost, to
the mysterious sound of <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>great flights of birds migrating at
night, one of the most romantic of sounds, but to me
untranslatable, since I do not know the language of these
wanderers.</p>
<p>I come now to human sounds.&nbsp; It was exciting to wake at 5
o&rsquo;clock some morning in June, and to learn by the sound of
scythes being whetted that the mowers had arrived, and that the
hay harvest had actually begun.&nbsp; The field had been a great
sea of tall grasses, pink with sorrel and white with dog-daisies,
a sacred sea into which we might not enter.&nbsp; But now we
could at least follow the mowers, and watch the growth of the
tracks made by their shifting feet, and listen to the swish of
the scythes as the swathes of fallen grass and flowers also grew
in length.&nbsp; There was something military in their rhythm,
and something relentless and machine-like in their
persistence.&nbsp; But our admiration was mixed with pity from
the time that one of them told us that after the first
day&rsquo;s mowing he was too tired to sleep.&nbsp; In later
years another sound was associated with haymaking, when in an
Alpine meadow the group of resting peasants were heard hammering
the blades of their little pre-Raphaelite scythes to flatten the
dents made by stones hidden among the grass.</p>
<p>A well-remembered sound that came near the end of the harvest
was the cry of &ldquo;Stand fast!&rdquo; which was heard at
intervals warning the man in the cart, whose duty it was to
arrange the pitched-up hay, that a move was to be made.&nbsp; Why
it was necessary to shout the warning so that it could be heard a
quarter of a mile away I cannot say.&nbsp; But its impressive
effect depended <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>on its loud chant-like tone.&nbsp;
This sound is connected with recollections of riding in the empty
hay-cart, from the sea-green stack mysteriously growing in the
corner of the field back to where hay waited to be carted.&nbsp;
The inside of the hay-cart was enchantingly polished, and also
full of hay-seed, which had a charm for me.&nbsp; The hay-making
at Down was a leisurely affair, with many women gossiping as they
gently turned the hay.&nbsp; There was, however, one man of whom
we children were much afraid, a fierce red-eyed old labourer who
acted as foreman, and did not hesitate to show that he thought us
out of place in a hay-field.</p>
<p>One sound there was peculiar to Down,&mdash;I mean the sound
of drawing water.&nbsp; In that dry chalky country we depended
for drinking-water on a deep well from which it came up cold and
pure in buckets.&nbsp; These were raised by a wire rope wound on
a spindle turned by a heavy fly-wheel, and it was the monotonous
song of the turning wheel that became so familiar to us.&nbsp;
The well-house, gloomily placed among laurel bushes, had a sort
of terrifying attraction for us, and I remember dropping pebbles
and waiting&mdash;it seemed ages&mdash;for them to fall into the
water below.&nbsp; We believed the well to be 365 feet deep, also
that this was the height of the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;I
have never tested the truth of either statement.&nbsp; The
opening was roofed in by a pair of hinged flaps, or doors, and I
especially liked the moment when the rising bucket crashed into
the doors from below, throwing them open with a brutal and
roystering air, which one forgave it as having made a long and
dangerous journey <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>up from the distant water.&nbsp; But
the best was when the empty bucket went down, and the fly-wheel
spun round till its spokes were invisible.&nbsp; Then was the
time to remember the death of a dog (called Dick) who was killed
by jumping through the flying wheel.&nbsp; I envied my elder
brothers who could actually remember Dick: to me he was only a
tragic myth.&nbsp; I imagine that in hot dry weather more water
was drawn, or else that being more constantly out of doors we
heard more of it.&nbsp; It is at least certain that the sound of
the well came to be associated with peaceful days and happy
weather in that dear garden.</p>
<p>Another sound I like to recall is connected with the memory of
my father.&nbsp; He daily took a certain number of turns round a
little wood planted by himself, and christened the
Sandwalk.&nbsp; As he paced round it he struck his heavy
iron-shod walking-stick against the ground, and its rhythmical
click became a familiar sound that spoke of his presence near us,
and was associated with his constant sympathy in our
pursuits.&nbsp; It is a sound that seems to me to have lasted all
those years that stretch from misty childish days until his
death.&nbsp; I am sure that all his children loved that
sound.</p>

FRANCIS GALTON <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a><br />
1822&ndash;1911</h2>
<p>Francis Galton was born on February 16th, ninety-two years
ago, and to-day we are met together to remember him&mdash;a word
that seems to me more in tune with his nature than the more
formal expression <i>commemorate</i>.</p>
<p>He disliked pomposity, but he seems to have loved little
private ceremonials.&nbsp; For instance, when he opened the first
notebook in preparation for his autobiographical <i>Memories</i>,
he began page I with Falstaff&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Lord, Lord,
how subject we old men are to this vice of lying&rdquo;&mdash;an
inverted appeal to truth which no man ever stood less in need
of.&nbsp; And again, at the foot of the very last page of his
<i>Memories</i> is a drawing of <i>Galtonia candicans</i>, a
little ceremony without words, a hieroglyphic glorification of
the honour paid him in giving his name to this African plant.</p>
<p>Many persons, and even some reviewers, form their opinions of
books by reading half-a-dozen passages at random.&nbsp; I have
been more scientific in selecting the first and last pages, and
from these I conclude that a simple and kindly commemoration <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>is not out of harmony with the genius of this great and
loveable man.</p>
<p>I should like to express my appreciation of the honour done me
in asking me to give the first Galton lecture.&nbsp; In many ways
I am a bad choice, since I have had no share in his science of
eugenics, neither has my research-work been directly connected
with evolution.&nbsp; I can only hope that in consideration of my
delight in the fibre and flavour of Galton&rsquo;s mind, with its
youth, its charm of humour, and its ever-springing originality
and acuteness,&mdash;I say that I hope these considerations may
excuse me for having undertaken an office for which I am in so
many ways unfitted.</p>
<p>One of his most obvious characteristics was his love of
method.&nbsp; I do not mean methodicalness, but that he took
delight in knowing how to do all manner of things in the very
best way.&nbsp; He also liked to teach his methods to
others.&nbsp; Those who never saw him, or even read his books,
will exclaim, &ldquo;What a bore he must have been.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One might as well call the lightning a bore for explaining that
the thunder was coming, or complain of the match for boring the
gunpowder as to the proper way of exploding.&nbsp; With
Galton&rsquo;s explanations there was a flash of clear words, a
delightful smile or gesture, which seemed to say:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all&mdash;don&rsquo;t let me take up your
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody was ever more decidedly the very
antithesis of a bore than Francis Galton.</p>
<p>He first appeared on the literary and scientific stage as a
traveller, geographer, and author of a book on South Africa
(1853), and it was the <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>experience there gained that enabled
him to write two years later, in 1855, that wonderful book,
<i>The Art of Travel</i>.&nbsp; There he teaches such vitally
important things as how to find water, how to train oxen as pack
animals, to pitch a tent, to build a fire, to cook, and a
thousand other secrets.</p>
<p>He liked, of course, to be useful to weary and thirsty
travellers, but he was as much, or more, impelled by the love of
method for its own sake.&nbsp; He was in fact an artist in
method.&nbsp; The same thing is shown in a letter he wrote to
Nature near the end of his life, explaining how to cut a cake on
scientific principles so that it shall not become stale.&nbsp;
This again was not so much a philanthropic desire that his fellow
men should not have dry cake, as delight in method.</p>
<p>When I re-read <i>The Art of Travel</i> quite recently, I
could not find his method of preventing a donkey braying.&nbsp;
My recollection is that, observing a braying donkey with tail
erect, he argued that if the tail were forcibly kept down, as by
tying a stone to it, the braying would not occur.&nbsp; I
certainly believe myself to have read or heard that this most
Galtonian plan succeeded.</p>
<p>Later in life he tried to make his unique knowledge of value
to his country.&nbsp; He writes: <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The outbreak of the Crimean War showed the helplessness
of our soldiers in the most elementary matters of
camp-life.&nbsp; Believing that something could be done by myself
towards removing this <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>extraordinary and culpable ignorance,
I offered to give lectures on the subject, gratuitously, at the
then newly-founded camp at Aldershot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He received no answer from the War Office, but a personal
application to Lord Palmerston led to his being installed.&nbsp;
He speaks of a few officers attending his course, and adds that
the &ldquo;rude teachings of the Crimean War soon
superseded&rdquo; his own.</p>
<p>In relation to what I have been speaking of, I must here be
allowed to turn back to an earlier period of his life.&nbsp; In
illustrating the different dispositions of his sisters, both of
whom were dear to him, Galton writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eldest sister was just, my youngest merciful.&nbsp;
When my bread was buttered for me as a child, the former picked
out the butter that filled the big holes, the latter did
not.&nbsp; Consequently I respected the former, and loved the
latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have we not here an early appreciation of method, or must we
merely class the memory with the scene in &ldquo;Great
Expectations,&rdquo; where the terrifying elder sister, Mrs. Joe,
prepares bread and butter for her husband and for Pip (her little
brother) in an eminently just and disagreeable manner.&nbsp; May
I be allowed to add that a love of butter in the big holes is not
hereditary in all branches of the family; I should have loved the
sister who picked it out.</p>
<p>At a later stage in his boyhood Galton transferred his study
of method from his sisters to his schoolmasters.&nbsp; He
describes what he suffered from the absurd limitations (which
still exist) in the education of English boys, and chafed at the
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>teaching he received.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grammar,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;and the dry rudiments of Latin and Greek were
abhorrent to me, for there seemed so little sense in
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He suffered in fact like his cousin, Charles
Darwin, who groaned over the classics at Shrewsbury School, and
forgot what he learned, even to some of the Greek letters, by the
time he was nineteen.</p>
<p>In 1838, when Galton was sixteen years of age, he became an
indoor pupil at the Birmingham General Hospital.&nbsp; Here the
education was at any rate practical enough, and to this coddled
generation it sounds a rough introduction to medicine.&nbsp; He
had to prepare tinctures, extracts, decoctions, and learned to
make pills by hand&mdash;a slow enough process.&nbsp; In later
life, when he saw a pill-making machine at work, it must have
been his boyish memories which inspired the characteristic
calculation that if a grandmotherly Government possessed
forty-five of these engines, it could supply each inhabitant of
the British Isles with one pill per diem.</p>
<p>It was in the surgery that he had most experience; he and the
other indoor pupils were called up at all hours to dress burns,
to patch broken heads, and reduce dislocations, with, as it
seems, very little instruction.&nbsp; It was doubtless a fine bit
of education in self-reliance, and he must have learned much that
was of use in his South African travels.&nbsp; Whether as a
student of method he approved of his rough and ready education is
not quite clear.&nbsp; His genius for experiment, or rather that
priceless capacity for extracting unexpected conclusions from
experience, comes out in his <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>account of a
case in the Birmingham Hospital.&nbsp; An injured drayman was
brought in dead drunk, and underwent amputation of the legs
without any signs of feeling pain.&nbsp; This set Galton
wondering whether patients might not with advantage be made drunk
before operations&mdash;a query which was to be happily answered
by the discovery of an&aelig;sthetics.</p>
<p>Another characteristic event was his attempt to learn the
properties of all the drugs in the pharmacop&oelig;ia by personal
experience.&nbsp; He determined to dose himself alphabetically,
but got no further than C., for the effects of croton oil put a
stop to his thirst for first-hand knowledge.</p>
<p>We must pass over his time at King&rsquo;s College, London,
where, as he sat at lecture, he could see the &ldquo;sails of the
lighters moving in sunshine on the Thames,&rdquo; a vision which
stirred his blood with a longing for adventure, and which, as he
characteristically noticed, always occurred when the weather-cock
on the Horse Guards showed that the south-west wind was
blowing.</p>
<p>We must, in like manner, skip his undergraduate days at
Trinity, Cambridge.&nbsp; We thus arrive by a devious route at
the period when he returned a traveller and geographer of
recognized merit, and began the work with which he was
practically connected for many years, as a member of the
Meteorological Committee.&nbsp; His best-known contribution in
the science was in a paper read before the Royal Society in 1862,
where his discovery of the anticyclone was first described; but
he also had a good deal to do with the printing and <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>publishing of the now familiar weather charts.&nbsp;
Meteorology takes us from 1861 to 1863, that is nearly to 1865,
when his first paper on heredity appeared, which was at the same
time his first paper on hereditary genius.&nbsp; This line of
research was to form his chief claim to celebrity and must be
separately treated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I wish to say something of his love of experiment,
which is a branch of his devotion to method.&nbsp; We know
something of the more entertaining of his inquiries from his
delightful book of <i>Memories</i>, yet I cannot but fear that he
has left out many experiments even stranger than those he
publishes.&nbsp; My father had a special affection for what in
his own case he called &ldquo;Fool&rsquo;s
experiments.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are what, I am afraid, Galton may
have omitted.&nbsp; Still there are records of some delightful
lines of work.&nbsp; He is probably the only man who ever
attempted to solve by experiment the problem of free will and
determinism.&nbsp; He limited his inquiry to the
question&mdash;whether there exists in human affairs such a thing
as an &ldquo;uncaused and creative action.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
experiment, or rather self-observation, was carried on (1879) for
six weeks, almost continuously, and &ldquo;off and on for many
subsequent months.&rdquo;&nbsp; He found that with practice he
could nearly always trace the &ldquo;straightforward
causation&rdquo; of a given action, which at first seemed to have
been performed &ldquo;through a creative act, or by
inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was his attempt to experience the feelings of the
insane.&nbsp; &ldquo;The method tried was to invest everything I
met, whether human, animal, or inanimate, with the imaginary
attributes of a <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>spy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The trial was only
too successful; by the time he had walked 1&frac12; miles to the
cab-stand at the east end of the Green Park &ldquo;every horse in
the stand seemed watching&rdquo; him, &ldquo;either with pricked
ears, or disguising its espionage.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds that
hours passed before this uncanny sensation wore off.&nbsp; On
another occasion he managed to create in his mind the feelings of
a savage for his idol, the idol in his own case being a picture
of Mr. Punch.</p>
<p>These experiments seem to me very characteristic of the man in
their originality, their humour, and their unexpected measure of
success, for personally, I should have prophesied failure in
all.&nbsp; They have a special bearing on Galton&rsquo;s belief
that a quasi-religious enthusiasm for eugenics may be built
up.&nbsp; I have sometimes wondered that he should believe this
great change so feasible, but I understand how he came to think
so when I read of his strange power of impressing beliefs on
himself, with such force as to leave a trail of discomfort in the
mind after the make-believe had ceased.</p>
<p>These and similar trials were, I think, made in relation to
his desire to weigh and measure human faculty in a broad
sense.&nbsp; I remember his telling me of his experiments on the
mind of the British cabman.&nbsp; His method was to use
alternately two different forms of the address to which he wished
to go.&nbsp; Thus on Monday he would tell the man to drive him
home to 42, Rutland Gate, on Tuesday he would say, &ldquo;Rutland
Gate, 42,&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; My recollection is that the
cabmen understood more quickly the familiar formula in which the
number precedes the name of the street.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>There was also a characteristic experiment or inquiry
into the intensity of boredom in a lecture audience, by counting
the number of fidgets per man per minute.&nbsp; In this case to
avoid the open use of a watch, he estimated time by the number of
his own breaths, &ldquo;of which there are fifteen in a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hope my brother <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> will forgive my adding that he found
the Royal Geographical Society meetings good hunting-ground for
fidgets, for as Francis Galton remarks, &ldquo;Even there, dull
memoirs are occasionally read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor must I forget his plan of marking, by means of a hidden
apparatus, the beauty of the women he met in the streets of
different towns.&nbsp; He classified them as pretty, ugly, and
indifferent; in this beauty competition London came out at the
top; Aberdeen, I regret to say, was at the bottom.</p>
<p>But in considering the measurement of human faculty we have
got quite out of any reasonably chronological sequence, for the
book bearing that title appeared in 1883.&nbsp; But the
estimation of human characteristics, especially in relation to
heredity, was in Galton&rsquo;s mind several years earlier, and
in 1865 he wrote the two papers in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> which contain the germs of his later work on
heredity and eugenics.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that the research
on heredity, together with its practical application to human
welfare in the new science of eugenics, should not have more
space given to it in his autobiographical <i>Memories</i>; there
are but <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>thirty-seven pages&mdash;or 11 per
cent. of the whole book.&nbsp; The specific importance of the
subjects here dealt with is so great that these thirty-seven
pages outweigh all the rest of the book.&nbsp; We should like to
have had a fuller account by the author of this remarkable work
of 1865.&nbsp; He does, however, tell us&mdash;and it is a very
striking statement&mdash;that the two articles &ldquo;expressed
then, as clearly as I can do now, the leading principles of
Eugenics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief point in which he came to differ from the
<i>Macmillan</i> articles was that he was then &ldquo;too much
disposed to think of marriage under some regulation, and not
enough of the effects of self-interest and of social and
religious sentiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; I imagine that the pendulum has
now swung the other way, and that one of the most hopeful and
practical schemes is the prevention of marriage among habitual
criminals and the feeble-minded.</p>
<p>Galton attributes his work in heredity in some measure to the
publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, which, he says,
&ldquo;made a marked epoch&rdquo; in his &ldquo;mental
development, as it did in that of human thought
generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Galton personally felt no difficulty in assimilating the
new doctrine, he characteristically ascribes to a &ldquo;bent of
mind that both its illustrious author&rdquo; and himself had
&ldquo;inherited from&rdquo; their &ldquo;common grandfather, Dr.
Erasmus Darwin.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in our day the name of Galton is
intimately connected in our minds with the science of heredity,
and we forget that he, like lesser men, was a mine fired by the
<i>Origin</i>.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;encouraged,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;by the new views to pursue many inquiries <!-- page
23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>which
had long interested&rdquo; him &ldquo;which clustered round the
central topics of heredity.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the charge with
which the mine had been loaded&mdash;the <i>Origin</i> was the
fuse.</p>
<p>When that book was published in 1859, nearly everyone here
to-night must have been too young to know anything of the great
change in the colour of human thought which was ushered in.&nbsp;
There are more who may remember how twelve years later, when the
<i>Descent of Man</i> came out, there was still plenty of
clerical and other forms of foolish bitterness.&nbsp; But a man
needs to have been in the full swing of mental activity in 1859
to perceive the greatness of the change due to the <i>Origin of
Species</i>.</p>
<p>His two papers in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, 1865
(Vol. XII., pp. 157 and 318), seem to me very remarkable, and, as
I have said, they are passed over too lightly by the author in
his <i>Memories</i> (p. 310).&nbsp; They contain a statistical
proof of the inheritance of intellectual and moral qualities. <a
name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; And those who would allow the
truth of this statement must further agree that it is the first
statistical demonstration of this important fact that the world
has seen.&nbsp; And he insists that the whole spiritual nature of
man is heritable, so that in his opinion there are no traces of
that new element, &ldquo;specially fashioned in Heaven,&rdquo;
which (he says) is commonly believed to be given to a baby at its
birth.</p>
<p>The paper contains a very interesting discussion on the
development of social virtues by natural <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>selection.&nbsp; He gives, too, a characteristic
explanation of that human attribute commonly known as Original
Sin, the quality, in fact, which makes men yield to base desires
against and in spite of their sense of what is right.&nbsp; He
says <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> that here &ldquo;the development of our
nature under Darwin&rsquo;s law of natural selection has not yet
overtaken the development of our religious
civilisation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be more briefly described as
the conflict between the individual desires with the tribal
instincts.&nbsp; It must be remembered that for all this
discussion Galton had no <i>Descent of Man</i> to guide him.</p>
<p>I shall come back later to his clear and courageous statement
of eugenics in 1865.&nbsp; Meanwhile I must speak of heredity, a
word, by the way, introduced by Galton, and for which he seems to
have been taken to task.</p>
<p>With regard to the machinery of reproduction the essay is
remarkable for containing what is practically identical with
Weismann&rsquo;s continuity of the germ-cell, and Galton&rsquo;s
priority is acknowledged by that author.&nbsp; But in science the
credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to
whom the idea first occurs.&nbsp; Not the man who finds a grain
of new and precious quality, but to him who sows it, reaps it,
grinds it and feeds the world on it.&nbsp; This is true of this
very <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i> article.&nbsp; Who would
know of these admirable views on Hereditary Genius and Eugenics,
if this were Galton&rsquo;s only utterance?&nbsp; This is the
grain which has increased and <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>multiplied:
and it is to-day familiar nutriment, and is now assiduously
cultivated by the Eugenics Education Society.&nbsp; But if
<i>Natural Inheritance</i>, and <i>Hereditary Genius</i> had not
been written; if the papers on eugenics had not appeared, and
especially if he had not convinced the world of his seriousness
by creating a eugenic foundation at University College, where his
friend Professor Karl Pearson carries on the Galtonian
traditions&mdash;why then the paper in <i>Macmillan</i> would
have counted for very little.&nbsp; But it was not quite
unnoticed.&nbsp; By my father it is referred to in the
<i>Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication</i>.&nbsp;
Galton was encouraged and reassured by Darwin&rsquo;s
appreciation of his work: his words in <i>Hereditary Genius</i>
<a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> are, &ldquo;I feel assured that,
inasmuch as what I then wrote was sufficient to earn the
acceptance of Mr. Darwin . . . the increased amount of evidence
submitted in the present volume is not likely to be
gainsaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was characteristically generous in
owning his debt to the author of the <i>Origin of Species</i>,
and characteristically modest in the value he ascribed to my
father&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>The book on Hereditary Genius strikes me as most
impressive.&nbsp; It seems as though the man whom the world had
agreed to honour as an admirable and indeed a brilliant worker in
geography and meteorology had suddenly grown big.&nbsp; He shows
himself to have the power of sustaining a weighty argument in
strong and temperate phrase, speaking as judge rather than
advocate, and to have definitely <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>taken rank
with Darwin, Lyell, Hooker and Huxley, men whose pens have dinted
the world, leaving their ineffaceable mark on the road trodden by
the march of science.</p>
<p>When I was working at the <i>Life and Letters of Charles
Darwin</i>, I naturally asked Mr. Galton for leave to publish the
letters he had received from my father.&nbsp; But he would not
agree.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin, he said, had spoken far too kindly of
his work, and he preferred to keep the praise to himself.&nbsp;
But later, when he wrote his <i>Memories</i>, <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> he fortunately realised that it is
wiser to think of the value to the world of such documents, than
of private likes or dislikes.&nbsp; The letter my father wrote
about <i>Hereditary Genius</i> which Galton says &ldquo;made him
most happy&rdquo; begins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only read about 50 pages of your book . . . but
I must exhale myself, else something will go wrong in my inside,
I do not think I ever in all my life read anything more
interesting and original.&rdquo; <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a></p>
<p>In reading this great book it is, I think, impossible to doubt
the strength of the work.&nbsp; The quiet relentless way in which
his territory is pegged out, and the clear wisdom with which the
terms of the new science are defined, are equally
impressive.&nbsp; And for lighter enjoyment his illustrations are
to be recommended.&nbsp; He has to settle precisely what he means
by a man being <i>eminent</i> or <i>illustrious</i> before he can
begin to ask&mdash;are these <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>qualities
hereditary?&nbsp; An eminent man is one in four thousand, and to
make clear what this implies, he writes: &ldquo;On the most
brilliant of starlight nights there are never so many as 4000
stars visible to the naked eye at the same time; yet we feel it
to be an extraordinary distinction to a star to be accounted as
the brightest in the sky.&rdquo; <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; If we could
imagine that each new night shows us a fresh set of stars, we
might speculate as to how many nights we should watch the sky
before we found one bright enough for a Galton.</p>
<p>In the same way he tries to make us see a million, because in
that number there is but one illustrious man.&nbsp; He worked it
out in Bushey Park, where he had gone to see the horse-chestnuts
in flower, and came to the astonishing conclusion that, taking
one half only of the avenue and the flowers visible on the sunny
side of that row, it would require 10 miles of avenue to give
1,000,000 spikes of blossom.</p>
<p>Later he defines <i>mediocrity</i> in a way not very
flattering to those, who, like myself, live in the country.&nbsp;
Mediocrity <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a> then &ldquo;defines the intellectual
power found in most provincial gatherings, because the
attractions of a more stirring life in the metropolis and
elsewhere are apt to draw away the abler classes of men, and the
silly and imbecile do not take a part in the
gatherings.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this last point, by the way, I am not
convinced.&nbsp; The research on the heredity of mental and moral
characters <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>leads naturally to eugenics, as in
the &lsquo;Macmillan&rsquo; paper of 1865.&nbsp; But before
dealing with this I must say a few words about what, in the
opinion of some, is Galton&rsquo;s chief claim to
eminence&mdash;the study of heredity as a whole.&nbsp; There is
no doubt that he was the first to treat thoroughly and in a
strict statistical method, the steps by which one generation
passes into the next.&nbsp; He was pre-eminently a lover of
statistics, he was indeed what Goschen called himself, &ldquo;a
passionate statistician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He used Gauss&rsquo;s Law of Error, which Quetelet had already
applied to human measurements.&nbsp; &ldquo;The primary
objects,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of the Gaussian Law of Error were
exactly opposed, in one sense to those to which I applied
them.&nbsp; They were to get rid of, or to provide, a just
allowance for errors.&nbsp; But these errors or deviations were
the very things I wanted to preserve and to know
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conception of variation impressed him deeply, so that he
remembered the exact spot in the grounds of Naworth Castle where
it first occurred to him &ldquo;that the laws of heredity <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> were solely concerned with deviations
expressed in statistical units.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What may be called the final result of Galton&rsquo;s work in
heredity is, I imagine, his <i>ancestral law</i>, namely that
&ldquo;the average contribution of each parent&rdquo; to its
offspring is one quarter, or in other words, that half of the
qualities of the child can be accounted for when we know its
father and mother.&nbsp; In the same way the four grandparents
together <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>contribute one quarter, and so
on.&nbsp; He illustrates this by calculating how much Norman
blood a man has who descends from a Baron of William the
Conqueror&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Assuming that the Baron weighed 14
stone, his descendant&rsquo;s share in him is represented by 1/50
grain. <a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>This side of Galton&rsquo;s work is, in the judgment of many,
his greatest claim to distinction as a master in the science of
heredity.&nbsp; How far this is so I shall not attempt to
pronounce.&nbsp; It is possibly still too soon to do so.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it seems to me that Mendelism, the main facts of
which are no longer in dispute, will compel the world (if it has
not already done so) to look at variation in a very different way
to that of Galton.&nbsp; The Mendelian does not, and never will,
look at variation merely as a &ldquo;deviation expressed in
statistical units.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can he accept the ancestral
law, because he has convinced himself that some ancestors
contribute nothing in regard to certain characters.</p>
<p>The contrast between Galtonism and Mendelism may be
illustrated by an example, which, if not a strict analogy, has in
it something illuminating, especially for those who do not know
too much of the subject.&nbsp; Galton seems to me like a
medi&aelig;val chemist, while Mendel is a modern one.&nbsp;
Galton can observe, or can follow the changes that occur when two
compounds are mixed.&nbsp; But he knows nothing of the mechanism
of what occurs.&nbsp; But the Mendelian is like a modern chemist
who calls <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>the chemical elements to his aid, and
is able to express the result of the experiment in terms of these
elements.&nbsp; This is an enormous advantage, and if my analogy
is to be trusted, it would seem as though a progressive study of
heredity must necessarily be on Mendelian lines.</p>
<p>But it obviously does not follow that the laborious and
skilful work of Galton and his school is wasted.&nbsp; Those who
wish to have made plain to them how Biometrics may illuminate a
problem which cannot as yet be solved in Mendelian fashion,
should read Dr. Schuster&rsquo;s most interesting book on
eugenics.&nbsp; I am thinking especially of the question as to
the heredity of tuberculosis and cancer.&nbsp; The relation
between Galtonism and Mendelism is also well and temperately
discussed in the late Mr. Lock&rsquo;s <i>Recent Progress in the
Study of Variation</i>, 1906.</p>
<p>But it is time to speak of Galton as a eugenist&mdash;on which
if we look to the distant future his fame will rest.&nbsp; For no
one can doubt that the science of eugenics must become a great
and beneficent force in the evolution of man.</p>
<p>We must be persistent in urging its value, but we must also be
patient.&nbsp; We should remember how young is the subject.&nbsp;
As recently as 1901 Galton was, in his Huxley Lecture, compelled
to speak of eugenics in these terms: <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It has not hitherto been approached along the ways that
recent knowledge has laid open, and it occupies in consequence a
less dignified position in <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>scientific
estimation than it might.&nbsp; It is smiled at as most desirable
in itself, and possibly worthy of academic discussion, but
absolutely out of the question as a practical
problem.&rdquo;&nbsp; After explaining that the object of his
discourse was to &ldquo;show cause for a different
opinion,&rdquo; he goes on with what, in his restrained style, is
strong language: &ldquo;I shall show that our knowledge is
already sufficient to justify the pursuit of this perhaps the
grandest of all objects.&rdquo; <a name="citation31a"></a><a
href="#footnote31a" class="citation">[31a]</a></p>
<p>At the close of the lecture he speaks out as to the
difficulties and the pre-eminent value of eugenics, and once more
of the oppressive &ldquo;magnitude of the enquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one who reads this lecture of Sir Francis Galton&rsquo;s is
likely to let eugenics go with a smile, and a remark that it is
not a practical problem.&nbsp; It is one of the functions of the
Eugenics Education Society to spread the sanely scientific views
here set forth by Galton, and as far as I am able to judge, the
Society has and is doing sound work in this direction.</p>
<p>In another essay, <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a> Galton discusses
the meaning of the &lsquo;eu&rsquo; in eugenics in a
characteristic way.&nbsp; He imagines an attempt among the
animals in the Zoological Gardens to establish a code of absolute
morality.&nbsp; With customary love of detail he supposes the
inquiry to be undertaken by some animal, such as a sparrow or a
rat, which is intelligent and has easy access to all the cages,
and is therefore <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>able to collect opinions.&nbsp; There
would be strongly pronounced differences between the carnivorous
animals and those which form their natural prey.&nbsp; There
would be a general agreement as to maternal affection, though
fishes and the cuckoo would laugh at it.&nbsp; But all would
agree on some eugenic principles: That it is better to be healthy
and vigorous than sickly and weak&mdash;well-fitted for their
part in life rather than the reverse&mdash;in fact, good
specimens of their kind whatever that kind may be.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton goes on to give a list of qualities that
&ldquo;nearly every one except cranks would take into account in
picking out the best specimens of his class.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
list includes &ldquo;health, energy, ability, manliness and
courteous disposition.&rdquo; <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; I wish he
had thought of eugenic mothers, and had translated manliness into
the feminine equivalents of courage and endurance.&nbsp; When I
first read this list it struck me at once how highly
distinguished was Galton himself in all these qualities.&nbsp; As
we dwell on the qualities one by one, they seem to call up echoes
from the image we have of his character.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ability,
manliness, and courteous disposition,&rdquo; how strong these
were in him!&nbsp; I cannot help feeling that he might have added
one more quality from his own treasure-house, namely, a sense of
humour, which is so priceless an antiseptic to sentimentality,
and was markedly present in his character.</p>
<p>In this same lecture <a name="citation32b"></a><a
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a> Galton sums up the
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>stages in the development of eugenics.&nbsp; (1)
&ldquo;It must be made familiar as an academic
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; (2) As a practical subject worthy of
serious consideration.&nbsp; (3) It must be &ldquo;introduced
into the national conscience, like a new religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He recapitulates in an eloquent phrase: &ldquo;It has, indeed,
strong claims to become an orthodox religious tenet of the
future, for Eugenics cooperates with the workings of Nature, by
securing that humanity shall be represented by the fittest
races.&nbsp; What Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly,
man may do providently, quickly, and kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we see the future of eugenics marked out for us, and the
last sentence might well serve as a motto for this Society.&nbsp;
How are we to work for the cause?</p>
<p>It is true that our opinions are formed by the daily papers,
and our actions as a nation are determined by political parties
which come and go largely by chance.&nbsp; But however our
opinions originate, if they are strongly and persistently urged
by a large majority of Englishmen, great changes in the manner of
human life may be effected.&nbsp; Persistence is the great thing
in all reforms: in the words of my father&rsquo;s favourite
quotation&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dogged as does it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Francis Galton has been temperately persistent in a marked
degree.&nbsp; His caution and wisdom are illustrated by the dates
of his writings on eugenics and heredity, which placed in order
suggest a regiment relentlessly advancing, not a bunch of heroes
rushing on a breach:&mdash;</p>

<p>His temperate advance is all the more striking when we
remember the fiery impatience with which in <i>Hereditary
Genius</i> he spoke of the harm done by the Church in ordaining
that the intellectuals, the literary, and the sensitive should be
celibates, and of the wholesale slaughter by the Holy Inquisition
of the courageous and clear minded who dared to think for
themselves.</p>
<p>From the first he had the support of Charles Darwin, who never
wavered in his admiration of Galton&rsquo;s purpose, though he
had doubts about the practicality of reform.&nbsp; His hesitation
in regard to eugenic method is expressed with a wise proviso as
to future possibilities: &ldquo;I have lately been led,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;to reflect a little . . . on the artificial checks,
but doubt greatly whether such would be advantageous to the world
at large at present, however it may be in the distant
future.&rdquo; <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; In the first edition of the
<i>Descent of Man</i> (1874), <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> he distinctly
gives his adherence to the eugenic idea by his assertion that man
might by selection do something for the moral and physical
qualities of the race.&nbsp; It is a great <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>thing that
this Society should have had Francis Galton for its Honorary
President.&nbsp; It entitles us to feel assured that in following
the line of action marked out for ourselves we are on the right
track, and that in the difficult pioneer work of helping the
English public to realise the deadly need of eugenic reform we
are following in Galton&rsquo;s steps.&nbsp; We are also so
fortunate as to have received encouragement and help at the hands
of some of the leaders in the science of heredity, Weismann, Yves
Delage, Ray Lankester, the late Adam Sedgwick, Poulton, Bateson,
and others.</p>
<p>Galton says somewhere <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> that great men have
long boyhoods.&nbsp; This was certainly true of him, though I
should rather describe as youthful the delightful qualities that
never faded out of his nature.&nbsp; It is, I believe, the
correct thing to speak of the &ldquo;golden dreams of
youth,&rdquo; and if by this hackneyed phrase we mean a keenly
imaginative outlook, a hopefulness with a certain dash about it,
a generous courage&mdash;tinged with romance&mdash;then Francis
Galton had undying youth.&nbsp; And this makes his seriously
measured progress in eugenics all the more worthy of our
admiration.</p>
<p>In one of the Macmillan articles he wrote: &ldquo;Many plan
for that which they can never live to see.&nbsp; At the hour of
death they are still planning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thus that Francis Galton died, and as year after year
we meet together on February 16th, let us think of him and his
plannings with affection and respect.</p>

THE MOVEMENTS OF PLANTS <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a></h2>
<p>It is sometimes asserted that the power of movement is a
character distinguishing animals from plants.&nbsp; This
statement arises to some extent from an obvious confusion of
thought.&nbsp; Trees are stationary, they are rooted to one spot,
but they are not therefore motionless.&nbsp; We think them so
because our eyes are dull&mdash;a fault curable with the help of
a microscope.&nbsp; And when we get into the land of
magnification, where the little looks big and the slow looks
quick, we see such evidence of movement that we wonder not to
hear as well as see the stream of life that flows before our
eyes.</p>
<p>In speaking of the cells of which plants are built, Huxley
said that a plant is &ldquo;an animal enclosed in a wooden
box.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is this prisoner, the living protoplasm,
that we may watch pacing round its prison walls.&nbsp; And we may
see it stop as though frightened at our rough usage, and then,
after a hesitating twitch or two, we see it recover and once more
flow round the cell.&nbsp; Or we can watch under the microscope
minute free-swimming plants rushing across the field of view, all
one way, like a flock of little green sheep that we can drive to
and fro with a ray of light for a sheep-dog.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>But I am not going to deal with microscopic matters, but
rather with things on a bigger scale which can be seen with the
naked eye.&nbsp; I will begin by trying to show that very obvious
movements are to be seen in every kitchen garden, or in every
garret window, where a scarlet runner is grown for its red
flowers&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>In a scarlet runner the shoot is not completely vertical, but
bends over to one side.&nbsp; To record the movements of the
plant a series of photographs may be taken vertically from above
the plant, so that the end of the shoot shows like the hand of a
watch against a sort of clock-face on which the points of the
compass are marked.&nbsp; Such photographs show how the shoot
swings round in its instinctive search for another stick to
climb.</p>
<p>This well-known movement is performed by a co-ordinated series
of curvatures, the exact nature of which need not trouble us
now.&nbsp; Let us rather consider the less obvious power of
co-ordination which enables a plant to grow upwards in a straight
line.&nbsp; Think of a forest of pine trees, hundreds of
thousands of them, all growing vertically up towards the
sky.&nbsp; Here is a clear case of movement, for the leading
shoots were once but a few inches from the ground, and now they
are crawling along vertical lines 100 feet up in the air.&nbsp;
It may be said that this is mere increase in size, not movement
in the ordinary sense.&nbsp; But it may be made plain that the
trees could not grow in this way had they not a power of
curvature, to which the term <i>movement</i> cannot be
refused.</p>
<p>As it is not easy to experiment on pine trees <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>we
may use a pot of mustard seedlings, which represents in miniature
a forest of vertical stems.&nbsp; Now suppose the flower-pot
upset and left lying on its side for a few hours: the seedlings
will be found to have all recovered the vertical position, and
they have done so by a bend which is just as much a case of
movement as the flexure of a man&rsquo;s arm, though it is
effected by a very different mechanism.&nbsp; Not everyone
realises how rapid this movement is.&nbsp; Fig. 2 is from a
diagram made in the ordinary course of class-work at Cambridge,
and illustrates this point.&nbsp; A shoot of Valerian was placed
horizontally at 2.17, and a black line painted like a silhouette
on a vertical sheet of glass to record its position at 2.30;
similar lines were painted at intervals, forming a record of
fairly rapid movement.&nbsp; If greater delicacy of observation
had been practised, it would have been easy to show that the
plant begins to curve up within a few minutes of being placed
horizontally.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that the plant should be stimulated,
or stirred up, to a definite curvature by merely placing it
horizontally.&nbsp; The curvature tends to bring the plant into
the upright position, and when the whole stem has reached the
vertical, the stimulus ceases to exist.&nbsp; It is as though the
plant were in a condition of content when vertical, and of
discontent in any other position, and as though the discontent
expressed itself in curvature.</p>
<p>But the plant does not gain the vertical by a single
continuous curvature; at first it overdoes the thing (see Fig.
2), and the end of the shoot may pass beyond the vertical by
20&deg;&ndash;30&deg;.&nbsp; But this new <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>position,
inasmuch as it is not vertical, originates a new stimulus, and
the new curvature which follows brings the shoot back towards the
upright position.&nbsp; It may again overshoot the mark, but by
repeated corrections it finally attains the normal upright
posture.</p>
<p>It is this power of correcting the line of growth whenever it
deviates from the upright that enables the pine tree to grow
straight upwards.&nbsp; And this is what I meant when I said that
its habit of growth depends on regulated curvature, to which no
one can refuse the name of movement.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The pine and the seedling have, in fact, a wonderful kind of
sensitiveness&mdash;a sensitiveness to the force of
gravity.&nbsp; To those accustomed to think of Mimosa as the
sensitive plant <i>par excellence</i> my words may sound
strange.&nbsp; But the sensitiveness of Mimosa is crude by
comparison with that of the seedling.&nbsp; A plant with a
perception of the position of the centre of the earth and a power
of growing <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>along the line so perceived is a much
greater miracle than a leaf that closes its leaflets when burnt
or cut or shaken.</p>
<p>I shall show that certain parts of the plant have the special
quality of the perception of gravitation, but we are at present
ignorant of how the act of perception is effected.&nbsp; We know
something of the machinery of hearing or vision in animals, but
in plants we can only guess that when a cell is placed
horizontally a resulting change of pressure on the protoplasm
produces that loss of equilibrium which is translated into
curvature.&nbsp; It is, however, probable that N&#283;mec and
Haberlandt are right, and that the stimulus depends on the
pressure of solid particles, <i>e.g.</i> starch-grains, on the
protoplasm. <a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p>The use of this gravitational sensitiveness is clear
enough.&nbsp; It is to the pine tree what a plumbline is to the
builder, for neither plant nor man can build high unless he
builds straight.&nbsp; A man has a general perception of the
verticalness of his body and of surrounding objects, but he does
not trust to this sense in placing brick on brick to make a
house.&nbsp; He uses a plumb-line which tells him through his eye
the precise line along which he must pile his bricks.&nbsp; The
tree has also to pile one over another the cells or chambers in
which its protoplasmic body lives, and this too must be done
along a vertical line; but the plant is guided by the
sensitiveness to gravity of which I have spoken.</p>
<p>It must be clearly understood that gravity does not act
directly on the growth of plants.&nbsp; It does <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>not act as a
magnet acts on iron, or to take a better example, it does not
simply act as gravity acts on the plumb-line in which the string
is kept in a vertical line by the weight.&nbsp; It might be
supposed that in some occult way the stem was mechanically kept
straight like the string, and this indeed was the view formerly
held about such roots as grow straight down into the earth.&nbsp;
But it is not so; the thing is not explicable mechanically.&nbsp;
Gravitation is nothing more than a sign-post or signal to the
plant&mdash;a signal which the plant interprets in the way best
suited to its success in the struggle for life, just as what we
see or hear gives us signals of changes in the exterior world by
which we regulate our conduct.</p>
<p>It may be said that this is hard to prove, and indeed, like
other biological theories, it can only be shown to be true by its
explaining a number of facts.&nbsp; It is interesting to try to
explain the facts without the assumption in question.&nbsp; If
gravity does not act indirectly as a signal it must act directly;
and we must find a reason why, in the case of the mustard
seedling above referred to, the stem has grown up and the root
down.&nbsp; There is absolutely nothing in their structure or
manner of growth to help us to see why this difference of
behaviour under identical conditions should exist.&nbsp; And if,
instead of placing the mustard seedling in the dark we had grown
it near the window, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> we should have come
across another remarkable phenomenon, namely, that the stem grows
towards, <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the root away from, the
light&mdash;and this is equally inexplicable on a mechanical
basis.</p>
<p>But it may be urged that it is not fair to compare a root and
a stem which are structurally unlike.&nbsp; Let us, therefore,
keep to roots.&nbsp; When the root of a bean has grown vertically
down into the soil for some distance it begins to bud forth into
side roots.&nbsp; These are exactly like the primary root from
which they spring; there is no difference in structure or in
machinery of growth.&nbsp; Yet the secondary roots do not grow
vertically down, but obliquely, or in some cases
horizontally.&nbsp; There is one more striking fact about the
roots of the bean.&nbsp; The secondary, like the primary roots,
give off branches, and these&mdash;the tertiaries&mdash;behave
differently from both the elder generations of roots.&nbsp; For
instead of directing themselves vertically or horizontally, they
simply treat the force of gravity with contempt and grow where
fancy leads them.&nbsp; The point on which I wish to insist is,
that it is impossible to explain on any theory of the
<i>direct</i> action of gravity why the three orders of roots
have three distinct modes of growth.&nbsp; They may remind us of
three generations, grandfather, father, and son, all of one blood
and yet behaving towards the universe in three distinct
ways&mdash;a fact not unknown in human society.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it would not be difficult to show that the
behaviour of the three orders of roots is well suited to the
plant&rsquo;s needs, and therefore we can understand how the
power of reacting in three different ways to the same signal has
been evolved.&nbsp; The main root takes the shortest course <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>to the deeper layers of earth; the four or five ranks of
secondary roots divide the world between them and push forth all
round, keeping slightly below the horizontal; the tertiaries take
it for granted that their predecessors have done the usual thing,
and that they can satisfactorily occupy the spaces left among
their elders by random growth.&nbsp; The fact that the tertiary
roots have no specialised sensitiveness of gravitation shows that
their unregulated growth is good enough for the necessities of
the case.&nbsp; For among organised beings necessity is the
mother of development, and what their brethren of second rank
have developed they too could assuredly have gained.&nbsp; To
this point of view I shall return, but first I should like to
give a few more instances of actions carried out in response to
the signal of gravity; and these examples shall be from
stem-structures.</p>
<p>The ripe flower-heads of a clover (<i>T. subterraneum</i>)
bury themselves in the ground, thus effectually sowing their own
seeds, and they are guided to the ground by their unusual
capacity of curving down and directing themselves like a primary
root towards the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>Other flower-stalks are guided by gravitation for quite
different purposes.&nbsp; Take, for instance, a common
narcissus.&nbsp; In the young condition there is a straight shaft
ending in a pointed flower-bud; but as the flower opens the stalk
bends close to the top and brings the flower-tube into a roughly
horizontal position, where it shows off its brightly coloured
crown to the insects that visit it.&nbsp; The flowers are guided
to the right position by the <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>gravitational
sense, and they increase or diminish the angular bend in their
stalk till the right position is attained, as shown in Fig.
3.</p>
<p>All these cases of plants executing certain useful curvatures,
which occur when the plant is displaced as regards the vertical,
and cease when the habitual, relation is reached, all these, I
say, seem to me only explicable on the theory that gravitation
does not act as a mechanical influence, but as a signal which the
plant may neglect entirely, or, if it notices, may interpret in
any way; that is, it may grow along the indicated line in either
direction or across it at any angle.&nbsp; It may be said that
this is no explanation at all, that it only amounts to saying
that the plant can do as it chooses.&nbsp; I have no objection to
this, if the meaning of the word &lsquo;choice&rsquo; be
defined.</p>
<p>I am now going to deal with the subject of movement from a
somewhat different point of view, namely, with the object of
showing that it is possible to discover the part of the plant
which reads the signal: and this is not necessarily the part that
executes the correlated movement.&nbsp; In the reflex movement of
an animal (for instance, a cough produced by a crumb going the
wrong way), we distinguish the irritation of the throat and the
violent action of the muscles of the chest and abdomen; and
further, the nervous machinery by which the stimulus is reflected
or switched on, by way of the central nervous system, from the
throat to the muscles concerned in coughing.&nbsp; In the plant,
too, if we are to compare its movements to the reflexes of
animals (as has been done by Czapek), we must distinguish a
region of percipience, another of motility, and the <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>transmission of an influence from the percipient to the
motor region.</p>
<p>Transmission of a stimulus has long been known in
<i>Mimosa</i>, but, in the far more important curvatures which we
are now considering, it was not known to 
<a href="images/p45.jpg">
<img class='clearcenter' alt=
"Narcissus flowers"
title=
"Narcissus flowers"
src="images/p45.jpg" />
</a> exist before the publication of the <i>Power of Movement in
Plants</i>.&nbsp; There is an experiment of Rothert&rsquo;s <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> which we make in class-work at
Cambridge, and which only differs from my father&rsquo;s
classical experiment in the fact that a much more perfectly
adapted plant is employed.&nbsp; The plant in question is a
grass, <i>Setaria</i>, which has a <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>remarkable
form of seedling.&nbsp; When the grain germinates it does not
send up a simple cylindrical sprout like an oat, but a delicate
stem terminating in a pointed swollen part which looks like a
little spear-head.&nbsp; When a group of <i>Setarias</i> is
illuminated from one side they bend strongly over, with their
spearheads all pointing straight at the light.&nbsp; The
spearheads do not bend; the whole movement is carried out by the
stalk on which the head is supported.&nbsp; And what is
remarkable is, that the spear-head and not the stalk perceives
the light.&nbsp; This is easily proved by covering the heads of a
few <i>Setarias</i> with opaque caps.&nbsp; For the result is
that the blindfolded seedlings remain vertical while their
companions are pointing to the light.&nbsp; Thus the part which
bends, is unaffected by illumination, and the part which
<i>is</i> affected does not bend.&nbsp; The spear-head is the
percipient organ, the shaft or stalk is the motor region, and
from head to shaft an influence has clearly been transmitted.</p>
<p>My father and I made an attempt to prove the same thing for
the gravitation-sense of roots, that is, to prove that the tip of
the root is the region in which the force of gravity is perceived
by the plant.&nbsp; Our method of proof does not hold good, but
our conclusions are true after all.&nbsp; When gravitation is the
stimulus, the experiment is much more difficult than when light
is in question, because now that fairy godmothers are extinct we
must not hope for a substance opaque to gravitation, a substance
with which we might shelter the root-tips from the force of
gravity as the tips of the <i>Setaria</i> seedlings were
sheltered from light.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>The plan adopted by us was simply to cut off the extreme
tip of the roots, and fortunately (or unfortunately) the result
was just what was expected&mdash;the tipless roots had lost the
sense of gravitation, and were unable to curve downwards towards
the centre of the earth.&nbsp; It was natural to believe that the
tipless roots failed to bend because their
sense-organs&mdash;their percipient parts&mdash;had been
removed.&nbsp; As a matter of fact they had been removed, but it
was fairly objected that the operation of removing the delicate
tissues at the tip of the root is a severe one, and that the
roots which refused to grow downwards were suffering from shock,
and not from the absence of their sense-organs.</p>
<p>The subsequent history of the inquiry is an instance of the
unwisdom of prophesying unless you know.&nbsp; In 1894 an able
summary of the question was published in a German journal, in
which the impossibility of solving the problem of the
gravitational sensitiveness of the root-tip was dwelt on, and
immediately afterwards Section K of the British Association had
the satisfaction of hearing Pfeffer read a brilliant paper giving
the long-hoped-for proof that the tip of the root is a
sense-organ for gravitation. <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>Like many other experiments, it depends on a deception or
trick played on the plant.&nbsp; The root is forced to grow into
a minute glass tube closed at one end and sharply bent in the
middle, resembling a little glass boot; the extreme tip being
thus <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>kept at right angles to the main body of the root.&nbsp;
If the theory we are testing is the right one, a root with its
motor region horizontal and its tip vertical ought to continue to
grow horizontally, because the tip being vertical is not
stimulated by gravity; it is in a quiescent, or, as it were, a
satisfied condition, and no bending influence is being sent to
the motor region.&nbsp; And this is what Pfeffer and Czapek
found.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the main body of the root
points vertically down while the sensitive tip is horizontal, a
curvature results, because as long as the tip is horizontal it is
stimulated, and the stimulus is transmitted to the motor
region.</p>
<p>This experiment proves not only that the tip of the root is
the sense-organ for gravity, but also that the motile part is not
directly sensitive; in other words, that gravitation is perceived
exclusively in the tip of the root.&nbsp; Since the publication
of Pfeffer&rsquo;s and Czapek&rsquo;s papers I have been lucky
enough to hit on another way of investigating percipient organs
for gravitation, <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> and I am not without hopes that
botanists may become in this question as fertile as Cyrano with
his seven ways of flying to the moon.</p>
<p>There is a certain kind of inverted action familiarly known as
the tail wagging the dog, and it is on this principle of
inversion that my experiment is designed.&nbsp; Inversion may in
some cases be practised without altering the final result.&nbsp;
For instance, it does not much matter whether the thread goes to
the eye (the rational masculine <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>plan) or
<i>vice versa</i>, as in the feminine way of threading a
needle.&nbsp; In other cases you create what is practically a new
machine by inversion, as in a certain apparatus in which the hand
of a clock stops still while the clock itself rotates.&nbsp; The
effect is still more striking with my plants, for the inversion
practised on them entirely changes the character of their
movement.</p>
<p>The result may be shown with the seedling <i>Setarias</i> of
which I have spoken, or with <i>Sorghum</i>, as in Fig. 4.&nbsp;
If one of these is supported by its seed with its stem projecting
freely in the horizontal plane, the gravitation stimulus makes it
bend upwards until the tip is vertical, when the stimulus ceases
to act and the curvature comes to an end.&nbsp; If the conditions
are reversed, if the seedling is supported in a horizontal
position <i>by its tip</i>, while the seed projects freely, the
result is at first the same, though finally it comes to be
strikingly different.&nbsp; The basal end of the seedling is
carried upwards by the curvature of the stem; but according to
the theory we are testing, the tip of the seedling is the only
part of the plant which feels the gravitational stimulus, and the
tip of the seedling remains horizontal in spite of the curvature
of the stem.&nbsp; Therefore the tip of the seedling is not freed
from stimulation as it was in the first case, where the curvature
brought the tip into the vertical position.&nbsp; The horizontal
tip therefore continues to send commands to the stem to go on
curving, in a way I can best explain if I am allowed to make the
plant express its sensations in words.&nbsp; The tip says to the
stem, &ldquo;I am horizontal, therefore <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>you must bend
upwards&rdquo;; and when this order has been obeyed the tip says,
&ldquo;It is of no use, I am still horizontal&mdash;go on
bending.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result is that the stem curls up into a
spiral like a corkscrew or a French horn, as shown in Fig. 4.</p>

</a></p>
<p>These unfortunate plants are in the position of a convict on
the treadmill; their movements are, from their own point of view,
absolutely ineffectual and meaningless.&nbsp; The results are,
however, of some importance from our point of view, since they
give clear support to the theory which I have now attempted to
place before you, namely, that the percipient region is at the
tip of the <i>Setaria</i> seedling, and that by what corresponds
to a reflex action, the stimulus perceived by the tip is
transmitted to the motor region.</p>
<p>I should like to add a few words on the question how far the
movement of plants can be placed under <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the general
laws deducible from the movements of animals.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, as soon as we attack this question we are liable
to enter regions where for the ignorant there are many
pitfalls.&nbsp; We are, in fact, face to face with the question
whether in plants there is anything in which we may recognise the
faint beginnings of consciousness, whether plants have the
rudiments of desire or of memory, or other qualities generally
described as mental.</p>
<p>If we take the wide view of memory which has been set forth by
S. Butler <a name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> and by Hering, we shall be forced to
believe that plants, like all other living things, have a kind of
memory.&nbsp; For these writers make memory cover the whole
phenomena of life.&nbsp; Inheritance with them is a form of
memory, or memory a kind of inheritance.&nbsp; A plant or an
animal grows into the form inherited from its ancestors by
passing through a series of changes, each change being linked to
the preceding stage as the notes of a tune are linked together in
the nervous system of one who plays the piano.&nbsp; Or we may
compare the development of an animal or plant to the firing of a
train of gunpowder, which completes itself by a series of
explosions, each leading to a new one.&nbsp; To use the language
I have been employing, each stage in development acts as a signal
to the next.</p>
<p>In the same way the characteristic element in what is done by
memory, or by that &ldquo;unconscious memory&rdquo; <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a> known as habit, is the association of
a <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>chain of thoughts or actions each calling forth the
next.</p>
<p>What I wish to insist on is, that the process I have called
action-by-signal is of the same type as action-by-association,
and therefore allied to habit and memory.&nbsp; The plants alive
to-day are the successful ones who have inherited from successful
ancestors the power of curving in certain ways, when, by
accidental deviations from their normal attitude, some change of
pressure is produced in their protoplasm.&nbsp; With the pianist
the playing of A has become tied to, entangled or associated
with, the playing of B, so that the striking of note A has grown
to be a signal to the muscles to strike B.&nbsp; Similarly in the
plant, the act of bending has become tied to, entangled or
associated with, that change in the protoplasm due to the altered
position.&nbsp; There is no mechanical necessity that B should
follow A in the tune; the sequence is owing to the path built by
habit in the man&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; And this is equally true of
the plant, in which an hereditary habit has been built up in a
brain-like root-tip.</p>
<p>The capacities of plants of which I have spoken have been
compared to instincts, and if I prefer to call them reflexes it
is because instinct is generally applied to actions with
something of an undoubted mental basis.&nbsp; I do not
necessarily wish it to be inferred that there can be nothing in
plants which may possibly be construed as the germ of
consciousness&mdash;nothing psychic, to use a convenient term;
but it is clearly our duty to explain the facts, if possible,
without assuming a psychological <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>resemblance
between plants and human beings, lest we go astray into
anthropomorphism or sentimentality, and sin against the law of
parsimony, which forbids us to assume the action of higher causes
when lower will suffice.</p>
<p>The problem is clearly one for treatment by evolutionary
method&mdash;for instance, by applying the principle of
continuity. <a name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; Man is developed from an ovum,
and since man has consciousness it is allowable to suppose that
the speck of protoplasm from which he develops has a quality
which can grow into consciousness, and, by analogy, that other
protoplasmic bodies, for instance those found in plants, have at
least the ghosts of similar qualities.&nbsp; But the principle of
continuity may be used the other way up; it may be argued that if
a lump of protoplasm can perform the essential functions of a
living thing, to all appearances without consciousness, the
supposed value of consciousness in Man is an illusion.&nbsp; This
is the doctrine of animal automatism so brilliantly treated by
Huxley. <a name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b"
class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; He is chiefly concerned with the
value of consciousness to an organism&mdash;a question into which
I cannot enter.&nbsp; What concerns us now is, that however we
use the doctrine of continuity, it gives support to belief in a
psychic element in plants.&nbsp; All I contend for at the moment
is, that there is nothing unscientific in classing animals and
plants together from a psychological standpoint.&nbsp; For this
contention I may quote a well-known psychologist, Dr. James Ward,
<a name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c"
class="citation">[53c]</a> <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>who concludes
that mind &ldquo;is always implicated in life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
remarks, too (<i>ibid.</i> p. 287): &ldquo;It would be hardly
going too far to say that Aristotle&rsquo;s conception of a
plant-soul . . . is tenable even to-day, at least as tenable as
any such notion can be at a time when souls are out of
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a path of inquiry I am quite incapable of
pursuing.&nbsp; It would be safer for me to rest contented with
asserting that plants are vegetable automata, as some
philosophers are content to make an automaton of Man.&nbsp; But I
am not satisfied with this resting-place.&nbsp; And I hope that
other biologists will not be satisfied with a point of view in
which consciousness is no more than a bye-product of automatic
action, and that they will in time gain a definite conception of
the value of consciousness in the economy of living
organisms.&nbsp; Nor can I doubt that the facts discussed in
these pages must contribute to the foundation of this wider
psychological outlook.</p>

A LANE IN THE COTSWOLDS</h2>
<p>Early in May I walked up from the valley to the extreme rim of
the Cotswolds, just above our house.&nbsp; The lower country is
all pasture, where we can wander at will, and delight in the many
beautiful trees: the fresh green elms, the vernal yellow of the
oak (which lingers in varying degrees behind some of its
companions, but does not deserve Tolstoy&rsquo;s epithet
&lsquo;maussade&rsquo;), and the grey anatomy of the timid ash,
whose black buds are still getting up their courage.&nbsp; We do
not owe the trees in the meadows to landowners with a taste for
natural beauty, but to the cattle that must have shade.</p>
<p>The buttercups are beginning their golden show, and there is
not much else to decorate the fields, except daisies and the
cheerful dandelions.&nbsp; These last are still growing
obliquely, and not yet staring boldly up at the sky, as in later
life.&nbsp; There is also an occasional patch of
bugle&mdash;sturdy little blue sentinels, and a few purple
orchids.&nbsp; In the upper meadows where the wind is cold the
daisies bend their stalk and lay their heads on the ground (as
they do at night), and their little noses look red like poor
Marian&rsquo;s in Shakespeare&rsquo;s winter song.&nbsp; In <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>the daisy it is the pink-tipped petals <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a> huddling together that make this chilly
symbol a contrast to the happy star that sunshine shows.</p>
<p>Near the top of the hill is a bare pasture covered with
cowslips, all pointing their pretty heads one way.&nbsp; At first
it seemed that they were simply yielding to the fresh wind, but
on picking them it was made clear that they bent their stalks
wilfully, not on compulsion.&nbsp; On the whole it seemed that
they were nodding towards the brighter light, but I could not
perceive that the quarter to which they turned had any advantage
in luminosity.</p>
<p>Close to the top of the hill is a little wood of nut-trees,
and I looked down into it over the hedge with a shock of pleasure
at the chequer-work of white and blue, a conspiracy of wild
garlick and blue-bells.&nbsp; In this land I have not seen the
blue haze covering acres of cleared woodland such as we have in
Kent.&nbsp; But this colour-dance of the two plants is beautiful
in its own way.&nbsp; Now we have reached the rim of the valley,
and look over into a new country, with many red patches of
ploughed land, and sheep in the treeless fields instead of
cattle.&nbsp; Here the skylark sings, who is something of a
stranger to us dwellers in the valley.&nbsp; The same is true of
the yellow-hammer, whose hot and dusty voice is less familiar
there.&nbsp; To one inland bred the seagulls feeding in the
ploughed lands are a delight.&nbsp; They seem an echo from the
salt sea, or a variation (in a musical sense) on the far away
silver <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>strip which is the Severn shining
down to the Bristol Channel.</p>
<p>We now come to a little wandering road, called for reasons
unknown to me Seven Leases Lane, and after a time end our
wanderings at a point whence we can look down on misty Gloucester
and its cathedral; and this is a historic spot if the rumour is
to be trusted, that from here King Charles watched the
siege.&nbsp; The lane is pleasant with its plashed hedges beset
with traveller&rsquo;s joy (clematis) and bryony.&nbsp; Clematis
likes to climb up trees, but it seems quite happy ramping over
the hedges.&nbsp; It is now in its freshest youth, and the
careless way in which the young stems toss themselves hither and
thither gives an impression of endless living things dancing with
complete abandon on the hedge as on an airy floor.&nbsp; The
traveller&rsquo;s joy climbs by seizing hold of the branches of
plants more solid than itself.&nbsp; It grips them with its
leaf-stalks, which serve as tendrils and support the weakling
stem aloft in the clear air.&nbsp; But as yet they have hardly
begun to fix themselves; though some I saw which had caught each
other, giving themselves a gay aspect by seeming to dance hand in
hand.</p>
<p>The white bryony is there also, and its tendrils have fastened
on to the hazel, beech and dog-wood, which make up the mass of
the hedge.&nbsp; Their tendrils are but delicate ropes, and when
they have seized a twig they would break away in the first fresh
breeze.&nbsp; But this is prevented by the fact that the tendrils
contract into spiral springs, and by the give-and-take of its
elastic coils the cable <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>becomes almost unbreakable and the
ship rides out the stiffest gale. <a name="citation58a"></a><a
href="#footnote58a" class="citation">[58a]</a></p>
<p>Two other types of climbing plants are common in our lane,
which have neither the grasping leafstalks of clematis nor the
delicate tendrils of white bryony.&nbsp; Black bryony is a
twining plant, and can travel spirally up the hazel stems, just
as a hop ascends its pole.&nbsp; But here in our lane there is
but little to climb up, and its livid pink stems, often twisted
with one or more brother-strands, lie along the hedge or sway in
the air like discontented snakes.&nbsp; Just now they hardly show
any leaves, but later in the spring they will have finely
polished ones, and later still bunches of red berries, which do
not seem to be popular with birds, and hang on their branches
till winter comes.&nbsp; Another type of climber which shows
itself early is the goose-grass. <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a>&nbsp; This is a
humble personage, probably looked down on by the superior
climbers above described, as able neither to swarm spirally nor
to ascend by the aid of tendrils or other gripping
apparatus.&nbsp; The goose-grass depends on the possession of
delicate little hooks covering stem and leaves.&nbsp; These can
be perceived by stroking the plant from the base upwards, but not
in the other direction.&nbsp; The hooks being directed downwards
do not hinder the upward push of the growing plant, but they
prevent it from slipping downwards.&nbsp; If one disentangles a
goose-grass from its position it will fall weakly over and lie
along the ground.&nbsp; In its <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>simple way it
gains the object aspired to by all climbers, namely the
possession of a satisfactory position in the world without going
to the expense of building a stem stiff enough to stand
alone.&nbsp; To children goose-grass is valuable as the ideal
material for the making of sham birds&rsquo; nests, since the
hooked prickles hold the stems in position and make the art of
nest-building a singularly easy one.</p>
<p>The great revolution that breaks out in the spring, when the
store-houses of the plant pour nutriment into the numberless
awakening buds is a miracle annually repeated in the endless
procession of life.&nbsp; We know something of the mechanism by
which mobilisation is effected.&nbsp; We know for instance that
the starch-grains guarded by the dormant plant during the idle
days of winter are liquified, or rather, that the starch is
converted into sugar, and being soluble in water can flow from
the magazines of the plant to where growth, implying the creation
of millions of newly born cells, demands material.&nbsp; We are
gradually learning to understand something of that seething
cauldron of life which we can dimly watch in living things.&nbsp;
The ferment diastase is one of the tools with which plants
perform their miracles of chemical activity.&nbsp; This diastase
and its brother-ferments have qualities resembling those of
living creatures.&nbsp; They may, like seeds, be dried and kept
in a bottle until they are awakened by giving them water.&nbsp;
Perhaps this is talking in a circle, and that ferments only
resemble living things because organisms contain so many of these
mysterious bodies.&nbsp; I like to fancy that there is <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>something more than this, and that a ferment is an
automaton which the plant compels to labour for it&mdash;a
Frankenstein monster having semi-living qualities, being no more
than a parody of life.&nbsp; But I am getting beyond the
questions that are in tune with a spring day.</p>
<h2><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>V<br />
JANE AUSTEN</h2>
<p>The most obvious characteristic of English country life as
described by Jane Austen, is a quietness such as even the elder
generation now living have not experienced.&nbsp; A quietness
which many would call dull and some few peaceful.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, hard to believe that life was once so placid, so
stay-at-home, so domestic, so devoid, not merely of excitement,
but of any change whatever.</p>
<p>The life of Emma Woodhouse (to take a single instance) has all
the characteristics of this deep repose.&nbsp; At Hartfield there
was certainly no changing &ldquo;from the blue chamber to the
green,&rdquo; a revolution which would have made Mr. Woodhouse
seriously unwell.</p>
<p>Emma never seems to leave home, she had not seen the sea, nor
indeed had she (before a memorable occasion) explored Box Hill, a
few miles away, although her father kept a carriage and a pair of
horses.&nbsp; Nor is there any evidence of her going to London, a
distance of sixteen miles.&nbsp; She did not engage in good
works; there were no committees or meetings except those held at
the &lsquo;Crown&rsquo; at which Mr. Knightly and Mrs.
Elton&rsquo;s <i>cara sposo</i> were the leaders, and where no
ladies were admitted.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>In comparison with the hurried unsheltered life of the
modern girl, Emma seems a princess shut in a tower of brass or an
enchanted garden.&nbsp; And although in the course of the story
she escapes this particular tower, it is only to fall into the
castle of Mr. Knightly, who (with his squire William Larkins)
plays the part of knight errant.</p>
<p>And Emma was not dull, but full of happy animation, and her
quiet life encouraged the growth of an educated, or at least a
cultivated, condition which re-appears in the other novels.&nbsp;
This placid life is all the more striking in contrast to the
great contemporary struggle of the Napoleonic wars, hardly a
sound of which reaches Miss Austen&rsquo;s readers, although in
<i>Persuasion</i> we do hear something of Captain
Wentworth&rsquo;s prize money.&nbsp; George Eliot knew the
flavour of this quietude, and reproduces it in the introduction
to <i>Felix Holt</i>.&nbsp; But even in these pre-reform days the
quiet is beginning to be broken; the stage-coachman is beginning
to dread the railway train, and looks on Mr. Huskisson&rsquo;s
death as a proof of God&rsquo;s anger against Stephenson.&nbsp;
Again, in <i>Middlemarch</i> we see the country stirring in its
sleep, and poor Dorothea suffering in the process of
awakening.&nbsp; There is nothing of this in Miss Austen; it is
true that the Miss Bennets sometimes experienced the blankness of
female existence, but they could imagine nothing blanker than the
departure of the militia from Meryton.</p>
<p>Jane Austen&rsquo;s books have something of the quiet
atmosphere of Cowper&rsquo;s <i>Letters</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Austen
Leigh in his <i>Memoir</i> speaks of her love for the <!-- page
63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>writings of Cowper and of Crabbe (the latter indeed she
proposed to herself to marry).&nbsp; We know that Marianne
Dashwood (that type of sensibility) was very far from finding
Cowper too quiet.&nbsp; For when Edward Ferrars failed to read
him aloud with spirit, Marianne remarks, &ldquo;Nay, mamma, if he
is not to be animated by Cowper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bagehot <a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> in his article on the <i>Letters of
Cowper</i> unconsciously describes the life at Hartfield or
Mansfield Park.&nbsp; Of Cowper he writes: &ldquo;Detail was his
forte and quietness his element.&nbsp; Accordingly his delicate
humour plays over perhaps a million letters mostly descriptive of
events which no one else would have thought worth narrating, and
yet which, when narrated, show to us, and will show to persons to
whom it will be yet more strange, the familiar, placid, easy,
ruminating, provincial existence of our great
grandfathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The domestic and intimate parts of life are the most lastingly
happy, and thus it is that an imaginary existence, which in some
moods seems to be unbearably humdrum, harmonises with the best
parts of our own life.&nbsp; The quiet winds that blow through
Miss Austen&rsquo;s imagined land cannot turn windmills or
overset tall trees, but they can set going those tunelike chains
of simple experiences written on our memories by the quiet and
happy parts of life.</p>
<p>Imaginative writing is often compared to painting, and Miss
Austen has spoken <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a> of &ldquo;the
little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>with
so fine a brush, as produces little effect after much
labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this gives a false impression,
suggesting a niggling character from which her work is
free.&nbsp; What strikes one is rather how much she conveys by
touches which seem trifling until we realise the triumph of the
result.&nbsp; The effect is not a miniature, as the author
suspects, but something essentially broad in spite of its detail,
like a picture by Jan Steen.</p>
<p>To discuss why Jane Austen&rsquo;s humour is admirable, or how
she reaches such perfection in the drawing of character, seems to
me as hopeless as to ask by what means Bach or Beethoven wrote
such divinely beautiful tunes.&nbsp; Her powers are rendered even
more admirable by the fact <a name="citation64a"></a><a
href="#footnote64a" class="citation">[64a]</a> that she did not
draw portraits, so that no one could say <i>A</i> is Mr. Collins
and <i>B</i> is Mrs. Palmer.</p>
<p>I think it is true, but not easily explained, that the
simplest people in her books give us most pleasure.&nbsp; Why is
Admiral Croft so delightful, and why do we read again and again
the speech about his wife, who suffered from sharing the exercise
prescribed for her husband&rsquo;s gout?&nbsp; &ldquo;She, poor
soul, is tied by the leg with a blister on one of her heels as
big as a three-shilling piece.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why do we delight in
Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s perambulation among his guests, and his
words to Jane Fairfax, &ldquo;My dear, did you change your
stockings?&rdquo;&nbsp; In this respect we have advanced beyond
the <i>Quarterly</i> reviewer of 1815, <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a> who says: &ldquo;The faults of these
works arise <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>from the minute detail which the
author&rsquo;s plan comprehends.&nbsp; Characters of folly or
simplicity, such as those of old Woodhouse and Miss Bates, are
ridiculous when first presented, but if too often brought
forward, or too long dwelt on, their prosing is apt to become as
tiresome in fiction as in real society.&rdquo;&nbsp; If ever a
reviewer &ldquo;damned himself to everlasting fame,&rdquo; surely
this writer did so; but, indeed, we need not have quoted so much,
since (in the words of Corporal Trim) &ldquo;he is damned
already&rdquo; for leaving out the &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; before the
name Woodhouse.</p>
<p>But six years later (1821) another <i>Quarterly</i> reviewer
(said to be Archbishop Whately) reversed the above unfortunate
judgment by singling out the drawing of Miss Austen&rsquo;s fools
as shining examples of her skill.</p>
<p>Jane Austen must surely be the most re-read author of the last
hundred years.&nbsp; Lord Holland is said to have read her books
when he had the gout, and in that case he must have experienced
what smaller people have suffered during less picturesque
complaints, viz., from not being able to determine which of her
books they have most nearly forgotten.&nbsp; In this frame of
mind one longs for a new Miss Austen more than for a new symphony
of Beethoven, or a play of Shakespeare, and much more than for
the lost books of Livy, which, indeed, I, for one, do not desire
at all.</p>
<p>The power of endlessly re-reading the novels of Miss Austen is
the only advantage conferred by a bad memory.&nbsp; I do not
imagine that Macaulay, greatly as he admired her, could have
endured to <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>read her as often as I have.&nbsp;
Nor am I willing to allow that this is intellectual idleness, for
her works like those of Nature, always yield something new to the
faithful student.</p>
<p>And she, like Nature, has the power of creating in her
devotees a minute interest which I rarely experience in other
writers.&nbsp; It does not seem to Austenites a foolish thing to
inquire what was Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s Christian name, a problem
only soluble by remembering that he thought it &ldquo;very
pretty&rdquo; of poor Isabella to call her eldest little boy
Henry, and by implication proving that the child, who should have
been christened John after his father, was named after his
grandfather.&nbsp; And I am proud to remember that when the
problem of Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s name was propounded to my
mother, she solved it at once, and as though it were a question
too simple to be asked.&nbsp; Nor does it seem to us trivial that
the word given by Frank Churchill to Jane during the
&ldquo;word-game&rdquo; at Hartfield was
&lsquo;Pardon.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was traditionally known in the
author&rsquo;s family, indeed Mr. Austen Leigh <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> says that she was always ready to
reveal such valuable facts as that Mrs. Norris&rsquo;
&ldquo;considerable sum&rdquo; given as a present to William in
<i>Mansfield Park</i> was one pound; that Miss Steele never
caught the Doctor, and that Mary Bennet married an unfortunate
clerk of her uncle Philip&rsquo;s.&nbsp; These revelations lend
an air of history to her romance, they give the exciting quality
of treasure-trove to the secrets she shares with us.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>here,&rdquo; as children&rsquo;s
books say, &ldquo;a very pretty game may be played by each child
saying&rdquo; what question he would put to the ghost of Jane
Austen.&nbsp; For myself I believe I should ask, &ldquo;Would
Fanny Price really have married Crawford if he had not eloped
with Miss Bertram?&rdquo;&nbsp; If in the words of Captain Price
there had not been &ldquo;the devil to pay&rdquo; in Wimpole
Street.&nbsp; Then, too, I should have liked some eugenic
information about Elizabeth&rsquo;s (Mrs. Darcy&rsquo;s)
children.&nbsp; Because if there was reversion to the type of
Lydia it would have been serious.&nbsp; One can fancy Elizabeth
retorting that if he said another word about the Lydia type she
would pray for an infant possessing all the qualities of Lady
Catherine de Burgh, a gift well within the powers of the gods who
rule heredity.</p>
<p>I doubt whether Jane Austen consciously painted the results of
heredity; rather, I suppose that her memory working
instinctively, made, for instance, the Bennet family consist of
types recalling the father or mother.&nbsp; She could hardly have
known of the questionable theory that the eldest child is
commonly inferior to the second, and nevertheless she makes Jane
Bennet inferior in capacity to Elizabeth, although so greatly
superior to the younger children of Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s type.</p>
<p>There are other cases of heredity among her characters; for
instance, in <i>Persuasion</i>, the snobbery and selfishness of
Miss Elliott clearly reproduces her father, while Anne, as we
know from Lady Russell, was a true child of her mother.&nbsp; I
like to fancy that the querulousness and weakness of Mary (Mrs.
Charles) was a perverted gentleness coming from <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>her mother,
while her vulgarity came from Sir Walter.&nbsp; Then again, Emma
had none of Mr. Woodhouse&rsquo;s qualities, and we must suppose
her to be a repetition of her mother.&nbsp; Unless, indeed, her
general kindliness came from her father, and possibly also the
stupidity which wrecked her matrimonial agency.&nbsp; We must, I
think, believe that Mrs. Woodhouse had been a managing woman, who
probably insisted on Mr. Woodhouse marrying her; thus her
instinct for matrimonial scheming was confined (we may fancy) to
her own interests.&nbsp; It is too fanciful to suggest that Mrs.
Woodhouse had a tinge of hardness in her which came out in
Emma&rsquo;s celebrated rudeness to Miss Bates.&nbsp; At any
rate, it is certain that it was not a heritage from her
father.&nbsp; I knew a lady who could never forgive this slip of
poor Emma.&nbsp; And the vividness of this feeling was not a
symptom of that want of literary sense which makes the gallery
hiss the villain on the stage, but must be taken as a proof of
the vitality of the character.&nbsp; Isabella Woodhouse is
obviously of her father&rsquo;s type, with hardly a mental
feature to remind us of Emma.</p>
<p>In the Bertram family the inheritance is not very clear; the
Miss Bertrams seem to show the hard narrowness of Mrs. Norris,
and none of the sheep-like good nature and futility of Lady
Bertram.&nbsp; I suspect that in Mrs. Norris, hardness and
business tendency were an inheritance from her uncle, the
Huntingdon solicitor, for we know that he made the harsh and
commercial statement that his niece was at least &pound;3000
short of any equitable claim to the hand of Sir Thomas.&nbsp; We
do not know <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>anything of the parents of Lady
Bertram, but we may suspect that her Ladyship inherited from her
mother the soft and cushiony character of which she is a great
example.&nbsp; Mrs. Price, with her small income and large
family, was unfortunately of the same easy and futile
temper.&nbsp; Edward Bertram is obviously his father the Baronet
over again, with all his kindness and extreme respectability,
while what will ultimately grow into Sir Thomas&rsquo; pomposity
is like the delicate tissues of the sucking pig in Charles
Lamb&rsquo;s essay, not to be described by the gross terms
applicable to the adult, &ldquo;Oh, call it not fat! but an
indefinable sweetness growing up to it,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; The
elder brother, Tom, who began life as a cheerful, irresponsible
person, falls under the family curse in consequence of a
mysterious fever, so that he doubtless inherited the fatal
tendency from Sir Thomas, together with a certain insouciance and
want of heart, which one can imagine to be forms of Lady
Bertram&rsquo;s emptiness and Mrs. Norris&rsquo;s hardness.</p>
<p>This is a subject on which a Mendelian inquirer might
endlessly speculate, but the characters in fiction being even
less susceptible to experiment than our living friends and
acquaintance, the interest of the matter is soon exhausted.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that Miss Austen did not allow the
characters of one novel to appear in the next.&nbsp; It is true
that this would have upset plots in an absurd way, but I should
like to know what would have happened if, when Henry Tilney had
made up his mind that he was in love with Catherine, Elizabeth
Bennet had appeared?&nbsp; He would <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>surely have
repented of his entanglement with Catherine.&nbsp; There is,
however, this to be said, that I strongly suspect Elizabeth of
being his first cousin.&nbsp; She is so like him that she might
have failed to please him, or he may have known her from a little
girl and looked on her as a sister.&nbsp; Or the marriages of
cousins may have been as impossible among the Tilneys as in the
Royal Family of Crim Tartary, where Bulbo&rsquo;s beautiful
Circassian cousin simply had to be allowed to die of love for
him.</p>
<p>There are many possibilities in the combination of characters
now separated by inexorable paper and ink.&nbsp; One can imagine
a meeting at Bath between General Tilney and Sir Walter Elliott;
they would clearly sympathise, and unless the General has injured
his complexion by incautious zeal on active service, which seems
unlikely, Sir Walter would have had &ldquo;no objection to being
seen with him anywhere&rdquo;; he might even have walked
arm-in-arm with him as he did with Colonel Wallis, who &ldquo;was
a fine military figure, though sandy haired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again,
Mr. Collins would have been charmed with Mr. Dashwood in <i>Sense
and Sensibility</i>, for although the two characters are not
quite similarly compounded of snobbery and folly, yet there is a
common substratum of meanness that must have served as a
bond.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to treat the whole of Miss
Austen&rsquo;s characters as the flora of a given land is dealt
with, to divide them into genera and species, and to provide an
analytical key.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the young men: these
would <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>correspond to a Natural Order, say
the Ranunculaceae, and may be divided, as the following table
shows, into two groups, Attractive and Unattractive, and these
are subdivided again into four groups which correspond to
genera.&nbsp; No. 1, which we should call Brandonia, possesses
the three species <i>Brandonia brandoni</i>, <i>ferrarsi</i>, and
<i>bertrami</i>, and so on with the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p71.jpg">
<img alt=
"Table of characters"

</a></p>
<p>Brandon, Dashwood, Ferrars, R. Ferrars, Willoughby are in
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>; E. Bertram, Crawford, Rushworth in
<i>Mansfield Park</i>; <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Mr. Collins, Darcy, Wickham in
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>; Tilney and Thorpe in <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>; Mr. Elton, F. Churchill and Knightley in <i>Emma</i>;
Wentworth and Mr. Elliot in <i>Persuasion</i>.</p>
<p>Then of course we should need descriptions to distinguish the
species, thus in genus (ii) Darcy would be known by pride,
Knightley by calm sense, Tilney by light-hearted cheerfulness,
while Wentworth would be easily recognised by his sub-dull
character.&nbsp; Naturalists would dispute whether Mr. Elton
should be in the same genus as Wickham, or in the quite distinct
genus (iv); or again, whether F. Churchill should not be placed
with Darcy and Knightley.&nbsp; In the same way Captain Wentworth
might perhaps be placed in the dull group with Brandon, Edward
Ferrars and Edward Bertram.</p>
<p>I have not attempted to include in the system all the young
men who occur in the novels.&nbsp; I leave the completion to
those who can devote a life-time to the subject, and who are
possessed of the necessary discrimination and patience to
marshall and arrange the whole flora of Miss Austen&rsquo;s
world.</p>
<p>In connexion with this subject I have found it interesting to
read for the first time quite recently Miss Austen&rsquo;s
unfinished novels, <i>Lady Susan</i> and <i>The
Watsons</i>.&nbsp; It is easy to classify some of the
characters&mdash;thus Mrs. Robert Watson is obviously Mrs. Elton,
as, indeed, Mr. Austen Leigh points out in his <i>Memoir</i>.</p>
<p>In the following scene the character addressed as Jane is Mrs.
Robert Watson, who has come to stay at the house of Mr. Watson,
her father-in-law.&nbsp; <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Elizabeth is
the eldest of the Watson girls, and keeps house for her
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you will find things tolerably
comfortable, Jane,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, as she opened the door
of the spare bed-chamber. <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;My good creature,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;use no
ceremony with me, I entreat you.&nbsp; I am one of those who
always take things as they find them.&nbsp; I hope I can put up
with a small apartment for two or three nights without making a
piece of work.&nbsp; I always wish to be treated quite <i>en
famille</i> when I come to see you.&nbsp; And now I do hope you
have not been getting a great dinner for us.&nbsp; Remember we
never eat suppers.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then: &ldquo;Mrs. Robert,
exactly as smart as she had been at her own party, came in with
apologies for her dress.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would not make you
wait,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;so I put on the first thing I met
with.&nbsp; I am afraid I am a sad figure.&nbsp; My dear Mr. W.
(addressing her husband) you have not put any fresh powder in
your hair.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is certainly Mrs. Elton&rsquo;s double, and the
resemblance extends to calling her husband Mr. W.&nbsp; It gives
one a certain shock of surprise to find an old friend
masquerading as a new acquaintance, nor is she the only example
in the book.&nbsp; I think the following speech of Mr. Tom
Musgrave will recall a well-known character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;whatever you decide on
will be a favourite with me.&nbsp; I have had some pleasant hours
at &lsquo;speculation&rsquo; in my time, but I have not been in
the way of it for a long while.&nbsp; &lsquo;Vingt-un&rsquo; <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>is the game at Osborne Castle. <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; I have played nothing but
&lsquo;Vingt-un&rsquo; of late.&nbsp; You would be astonished to
hear the noise we make there&mdash;the fine old lofty
drawing-room rings again.&nbsp; Lady Osborne sometimes declares
she cannot hear herself speak.&nbsp; Lord Osborne enjoys it
famously, and he makes the best dealer without exception that I
ever beheld&mdash;such quickness and spirit, he lets nobody dream
over their cards.&nbsp; I wish you could see him over-draw
himself on both his own cards.&nbsp; It is worth anything in the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may surely recognise the folly and underbred parade of Mr.
John Thorpe in Mr. Tom Musgrave&rsquo;s speech.&nbsp; Again, Tom
Musgrave plagues Emma just as Thorpe persecuted Catherine by an
ill-timed invitation to a <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i> curricle
drive.</p>
<p>The heroine, Emma Watson, has no resemblance to Emma
Woodhouse.&nbsp; In situation she may be compared to Fanny Price,
for she has been brought up by a refined aunt, and is suddenly
plunged into the very different manners and surroundings of her
pushing jealous sisters; but in character she seems to me to have
none of the charm which has given Fanny Price such various
admirers as the Rev. Sydney Smith and Mr. F. W. H. Myers. <a
name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; It is perhaps characteristic of
her creator&rsquo;s truth, that her heroine who is made known to
us just as she arrives at her new home in uncomfortable <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>surroundings and among unknown sisters, should be
reserved and a little prim, and that we should be made to feel
that this was not her complete character.&nbsp; Possibly she
would have developed into a Fanny Price with a strong touch of
Eleanor Dashwood, but this is a barren speculation.</p>
<p>Another unfinished novel was begun in January, 1817, and
twelve chapters were written by the middle of March.&nbsp; Miss
Austen died on July 18 of that same year.&nbsp; This unnamed
novel, to judge by extracts published in the <i>Memoir</i> (p.
181), promised to contain at least one admirable character in the
person of Lady Denham, who seems an ill-natured and grasping Mrs.
Jennings (if that is not a contradiction in terms), with a strong
flavour of Lady Catherine de Burgh.</p>
<p>Miss Austen&rsquo;s works are not only to be studied from the
point of view of genetics, nor merely by a naturalist whose
desire is to classify without inquiry as to the origin of his
species; they also supply material for the geographer.&nbsp; I do
not know who first identified the Highbury of <i>Emma</i> with
Cobham, as being seven miles from Boxhill and 18 from London
(&ldquo;sixteen miles, nay 18, it must be full 18 to Manchester
Street&rdquo;).&nbsp; The identification is confirmed by a slip
on the part of the authoress, who, in a single passage, printed
Cobham in place of Highbury.&nbsp; By this method of mensuration
my friend the Master of Downing has shown Kellynch Hall in
<i>Persuasion</i> to be near Buckland St. Mary, and Mansfield
Park to coincide roughly with Easton, near Huntingdon.</p>
<p>The geography of Lyme Regis is of interest.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>The party from Upper Cross drove in a leisurely way to
Lyme, and the afternoon was well advanced as they descended the
steep hill into the village.&nbsp; The hill is doubtless much as
it was, and nearly at the bottom are the two hotels mentioned; it
is, honestly speaking, impossible to say at which of the two the
Musgroves put up.&nbsp; I am inclined to believe it was that on
the west side, but my reasons, if indeed they exist, are not
worth giving.</p>
<p>The house in which Miss Austen is known to have stayed is
probably Captain Harville&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is near the Cobb, and
presents that air of not having much room inside, which we gather
from the description in <i>Mansfield Park</i>.</p>
<p>But these points are of trifling interest in comparison with
the really important question&mdash;where did Louisa&rsquo;s
accident occur?&nbsp; There are three separate flights of steps
on the Cobb, and the local photographer, in the interests of
trade, had to fix on one of them as the scene of the jump.&nbsp;
I cannot believe that he is right.&nbsp; These steps are too high
and too threatening for a girl of that period to choose with such
a purpose, even for Louisa, whose determination of character we
know to have been one of her charms.&nbsp; Then, again, this
particular flight is not (so far as I could make out) in the New
Cobb, which is where the accident is described as
occurring.&nbsp; It is true that at first sight it hardly looks
dangerous enough to bring about the sight which delighted the
fishermen of Lyme, namely, a &ldquo;dead young lady,&rdquo; or
rather two, for the sensitive Mary contributed to the situation
by fainting.&nbsp; I am, however, confirmed in my belief <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>by what happened to myself, when I went to view the
classic spot.&nbsp; I quite suddenly and inexplicably fell
down.&nbsp; The same thing happened to a friend on the same spot,
and we concluded that in the surprisingly slippery character of
the surface lies the explanation of the accident.&nbsp; It had
never seemed comprehensible that an active and capable man should
miss so easy a catch as that provided by Louisa.&nbsp; But if
Captain Wentworth slipped and fell as she jumped, she would come
down with him.</p>
<p>I am told that when Tennyson visited Lyme he repelled the
proposals of his friends, who wished him to see something of the
beauties of the place, and insisted on going straight to the
flight of steps.&nbsp; This is an attractive trait in
Tennyson&rsquo;s character, but it may not have been pleasing to
his hosts.</p>

THE EDUCATION OF A MAN OF SCIENCE</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">An Address to the Association of
University<br />
Women Teachers, January 13, 1911</p>
<p>In the following pages I propose to give my own experience of
education, that is to say, not of educating others, but of being
educated.&nbsp; It seems to me that the education of one&rsquo;s
youth becomes clear to one in middle life and old age; and that
what one sees in this retrospect may be worth some rough record
and some sort of criticism.&nbsp; One may, of course, be mistaken
about what was bad and what was good in one&rsquo;s
training.&nbsp; But the experience of the pupil is, at the least,
one aspect of the question.&nbsp; And I think that the memories
of how we were taught is something much more definite and vivid,
something that can be more easily made interesting to one&rsquo;s
readers, than the generalised experience gained as a teacher.</p>
<p>Any record of education which extends fifty years back has a
certain value, and my experience may serve as a stepping-stone to
that of my father, of which we fortunately have an account in his
own words, and these take us back to a period more than one
hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Those of us who are inclined to despair over education as an
inherent misfortune of youth, may <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>be encouraged
by this putting down of milestones, and may almost believe that
we have moved in the right direction.&nbsp; Whereas, to those
optimists who are cheerfully and unhesitatingly educating their
allotted prey of children, it may be as salutary, as a cautionary
story, to realise that the same optimism ruled one hundred years
ago, when the Eton latin grammar was a symbol to innumerable
complacent schoolmasters of what was best in the best of all
possible worlds.&nbsp; But the chief part of what I have to say
is autobiographical, and I have only an occasional remark to make
on the progress and improvement that have occurred in
education.</p>
<p>My ignorance of educational methods may probably lead me to
repeat what is well known; because what seems to me bad in my
training has doubtless been recognised as such by modern
teachers, nor can I hope to have anything very new to say about
what seems to me to have been good.</p>
<p>As children, we, my brothers and sisters, were treated by our
parents in a way the very reverse of the pitiless 18th and early
19th century manner&mdash;the spirit of those surprising stories
such as the <i>Purple Jar</i>, where the child is deceived by her
abominable parent.&nbsp; In fact, a chief characteristic of our
parents&rsquo; treatment of us was their respect for our liberty
and our personality.&nbsp; We were made to feel that we were
&ldquo;creatures whose opinions and thoughts were valuable to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The happy relations with our elders which we enjoyed in the
holidays to some extent counteracted the evil effects of going to
school.&nbsp; The worst of a boarding-school is that it is a
republic <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>of children, where the citizens are
saturated in the traditions and conventions peculiar to
themselves, and are, for more than half their lives, deprived of
the saner ideals of grown-up people.&nbsp; Before we went to
school we were taught by governesses.&nbsp; I cannot help wishing
that we had had foreign teachers who would have taught us to
speak their language&mdash;a thing that can be done so easily in
childhood.&nbsp; I have never got over the want of fluent French
and German, and I resent the fact that I should be condemned to
feel like a child or a boor in the presence of foreigners.&nbsp;
We are taught Latin and Greek because, as we are assured, they
introduce us to the finest literature in the world.&nbsp; To most
boys they do nothing of the kind, and are an intolerable
burden.&nbsp; French and German taught by the oral methods really
do introduce us to whole nations of minds that are otherwise cut
off from us; and not merely minds mirrored in books, but more
especially those of human beings as given in speech.</p>
<p>This is all very familiar, I only mention it because it is a
special case of a wider question, namely: How much can be safely
poured into a receptive child which he will be thankful for as he
gets older?&nbsp; I mean, rather: What is the proportion that
ought to be maintained between learning to reason, <i>e.g.</i>,
Euclid; exercising the attentive faculties, <i>e.g.</i>, in
plodding through a Latin book with a dictionary; and the more or
less mechanical acquirement, as in learning by heart?&nbsp; Why
was I not taught addition by memorising tables as in the case of
multiplication?&nbsp; It could <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>have been
built into the structure of my mind equally well, and would have
saved much misery.&nbsp; It is, of course, essential that what is
learned should be true.&nbsp; I have heard a credibly attested
story of a dame-school at the beginning of last century, where
class and teacher were heard chanting together: Twice 1 is 2,
twice 2 is 3, twice 3 is 4, etc.</p>
<p>I certainly believe in learning by heart, and I am grateful
for having learned many dates at school; most of them are
forgotten, but enough to be of some use are retained.&nbsp; The
worst of it is that I am as likely to know the date of the Flood
as that of the Fire of London, and of the battle of Arbela as
that of Worcester.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for having been made to learn Shakespeare
by heart, although we had to do it before breakfast.&nbsp; I do
not imagine that I now remember any of it, but it gave me some
idea of the beauty of literature, which I hardly gained at all
from the classics.&nbsp; It also started me reading Shakespeare
out of school.&nbsp; I believe this is the easiest way of
supplying some modicum of literature to a boy who cannot get it
out of Latin and Greek.&nbsp; And a kind of Cowper-Temple
Shakespeare, without note or comment, is more effective than
regular so-called literary lessons, and the worrying of boys
about the metre or the difference between a hawk and a
handsaw.&nbsp; A boy does not want to understand everything, and
he likes to get his poetry in a book which looks as if it were
meant for reading, not for cramming or for holiday tasks.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Personally, I also resent that I was not taught at
school to read music by the sol-fa system, which is another of
the things that can be poured into most children not only easily
but with pleasure to themselves.&nbsp; I have been assured by a
learned musician, that in the 17th century reading music was as
much a sign of culture as reading a book.&nbsp; There was
recently an excellent letter in the <i>Times</i> <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a> on public school music, pleading that
boys should be allowed to drop, let us say greek iambics, and
devote the time to serious musical study.&nbsp; The writer
describes how at a certain school a good professional orchestra
gives a concert once in each term, for which the boys are
prepared by having the themes of the movements, <i>e.g.</i> of a
Beethoven symphony, played over to them on the piano and
expounded.&nbsp; He describes how an athletic boy, a member of
the football team, declared, when the concert was over, that
there was nothing to live for during the rest of the half,
apparently not even football.&nbsp; No wonder that the writer of
this letter should respectfully deride a former Head Master of
Eton for his approval of choral singing, on account of its
&ldquo;moral and political value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have always felt that the best teaching I received was in
two practical matters, viz., how to play the flute, and how to
use a microscope.&nbsp; It may be said that these were subjects
in which I took a natural and spontaneous interest, and were
therefore easily taught.&nbsp; This is no doubt partly true, but
I do not think it depended on any special attraction <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>for
music or microscopy, but on something wider&mdash;on the novelty
of being taught to do something physical, something with
one&rsquo;s hands and ears and eyes.&nbsp; I am sure boys ought
to have more practical teaching&mdash;not necessarily in science,
but such things as mild carpentering, the tying of knots, and
such exercise in rough weighing and measuring as would form a
basis for a little elementary physics.&nbsp; The same is true of
girls, and in one way they need handiwork more than boys.&nbsp; I
found, in my Cambridge class of practical plant-physiology, that
the girls had not such &lsquo;deft fingers&rsquo; as their
brothers; I believe the difference is largely due to the boys
having played with string and knives, etc., for many idle
hours.&nbsp; Both boys and girls must be taught to use, not only
their hands, but their eyes.&nbsp; It seems to me piteous that
when I was at school there was absolutely nothing done to keep
alive the natural sharp-eyedness of children.&nbsp; I remember
vividly the intense pleasure which my father gave me (a very
small boy) by showing surprise at my knowledge of common trees
and shrubs in a winter coppice.&nbsp; I am sure that school did
much to kill the power of observation in me.</p>
<p>It may be that observation is an essentially transitory
quality, a fleeting ancestral reminiscence, a trail of glory,
like other savage traits in children.&nbsp; But more than now
survives might be preserved to us by training at school.&nbsp; It
ought not to be possible for a boy to come up to a University so
blind and helpless as to describe a wall-flower (which has six
obvious stamens arranged in a striking pattern) as having
&ldquo;about five stamens.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Yet this I
experienced in an examination of medical students.&nbsp;
Describing an object placed before him is excellent training in
observation for a boy.&nbsp; And the capacity of describing an
object by memory should also be cultivated.&nbsp; Remember what
Dr. Noel says in Stevenson&rsquo;s story of the Saratoga Trunk,
and how we may fail in a question of life and death because we
cannot describe the mysterious stranger who dogs our
footsteps.</p>
<p>To return for a moment to the description of an object.&nbsp;
It not only practises the power of observation, but is also
excellent exercise in writing English, far better as it seems to
me than the usual essay on the usual subjects.&nbsp; In
describing a given object the pupil has not to seek for
material&mdash;it is there before him.&nbsp; He need not recall
his feelings during a country walk, or the way he spent his time
in the Christmas holidays, or vainly search for facts on the
character of Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; He can concentrate on
arrangement, on directness and clearness.&nbsp; My experience of
the essays set to candidates in the Natural Science Tripos was
most depressing.&nbsp; A man who could write a good plain answer
to an ordinary examination question becomes ornate and tiresome
when he is told to write an essay.&nbsp; Such candidates have
clearly never heard the admirable statement by Canon Ainger of
the style expected in writers in the Dictionary of Natural
Biography, &ldquo;No flowers by request.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can
they have known that other bit of advice, &ldquo;You have no idea
what strength it gives to your style to leave out every other
word.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard suggested another method of
checking the natural <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>diffuseness of the youthful essayist,
namely, to make him confine himself to a definite number of
words, I have even heard an essay on a post card recommended.</p>
<p>For myself, I believe the best exercise in English I ever had
was the correction of my father&rsquo;s proof-sheets.&nbsp; What
I found so educational was the necessity of having to explain
clearly and exactly why I objected to a given sentence, since I
naturally could not baldly express my disapproval.&nbsp; It was
not only good training, but as has been well said by my sister
(who also helped in this way), &ldquo;It was inexpressibly
exhilarating to work for him&rdquo;&mdash;and she
continues&mdash;referring to the generous way in which he took
our suggestions, &ldquo;I think I felt the singular modesty and
graciousness of his nature through thus working for him in a way
I should never otherwise have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How far every boy ought to be made to do mathematics (beyond
simple arithmetic) I cannot say.&nbsp; I know that I am extremely
grateful for the small amount of mathematics forced into
me.&nbsp; I am even thankful for a very mechanical side of the
subject, namely, the use of mathematical tables in general, and
for being compelled to work out innumerable sums by logarithms,
which we had to do in a &ldquo;neat tabular form&rdquo; to quote
our precise master&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Certainly my opportunities were strikingly better than my
father&rsquo;s, who records that at Shrewsbury School nothing <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a> was taught but classics, <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>ancient history and ancient geography.&nbsp; Euclid,
which he liked and felt to be educational, was taught by a
private tutor who had the attractive characteristic of wearing
top boots.</p>
<p>I now pass from general education to the teaching of
science.&nbsp; When I went to Cambridge in 1866, the teaching, as
far as the biological sciences went, was in a somewhat dead
condition.&nbsp; Indeed, I hardly think it had advanced much from
the state of things which existed in 1828, when my father entered
Christ&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; Cambridge was a turning point in
his scientific life, chiefly through Professor Henslow&rsquo;s
discovery that the youth, whom his father Dr. R. W. Darwin
thought likely to be a mere sporting man and a disgrace to his
family, was really a remarkable person, possessed by a burning
zeal for science.&nbsp; Henslow made a friend of my father (he
was known as the &ldquo;man who walks with Henslow&rdquo;), and
recommended him as naturalist to the &ldquo;Beagle,&rdquo; where
he was made into a man of science.</p>
<p>In my time there were two ways of acquiring knowledge:
attending the lectures of University professors, and going to a
<i>coach</i>.&nbsp; Lectures, as my father has said, have
&ldquo;no advantages and many disadvantages . . . compared with
reading.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the same view (or heresy as he
confesses it to be) has been well given by the late Henry
Sidgwick in his <i>Miscellaneous Essays</i> (1904).&nbsp; He
holds that a purely expository lecture, without experiments or
specimens, is something very like a barbarism, an echo of the
days before printing was invented.&nbsp; He points out too how
there is every temptation to the <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>teacher not
to publish his lectures.&nbsp; Thus the students who live
elsewhere, and therefore cannot attend his course, &ldquo;are
deprived of useful instruction,&rdquo; and the students who do
attend them have to receive it in an inconvenient form, in order
that the Professor may be enabled to fulfil with
<i>&eacute;clat</i> the traditional conception of his function
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 347).&nbsp; One set of lectures, which as a
medical student I was compelled to attend, were so dull that I
literally could not listen to them, but I got into a quiet corner
and read Swift&rsquo;s <i>Journal to Stella</i>, and for that
opportunity I am certainly grateful.</p>
<p>A course I thoroughly liked was that given by the late Sir
George Humphry, the Professor of Anatomy.&nbsp; He used to sit
balancing himself on a stool, with his great hungry eyes fixed on
us, talking in plain direct terms of anatomy enlivened by
physiology.&nbsp; The one point that remains with me is the way
in which he would stop and wonder over the facts he brought
before us: &ldquo;This is a wonderful thing, one of the most
wonderful things in the world, I know nothing about it&mdash;no
one knows&mdash;you had better try and find out, some of
you&rdquo;; simple words enough, but they struck a chord of
romance in some of his hearers.&nbsp; I remember another teacher
of anatomy in London who stirred our wonder in quite another way,
for he made us marvel how any man could repeat by heart
Gray&rsquo;s book on Anatomy for an hour, and wonder too, why we
should be compelled to listen.</p>
<p>The private tutors or coaches to whom most Cambridge students
of natural history went were, as far as my experience went,
hopelessly bad.&nbsp; My <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>coach tried
to ensure that I knew certain inferior books well enough to be
examined in them, but he never showed me a specimen, and never
attempted to ensure that I should have any sort of first-hand
knowledge.&nbsp; We were also taught by the Curator of the
Botanic Garden, a completely uneducated man, and in all ways as
different from the present learned and cultivated Curator as it
is possible to imagine.&nbsp; He, like my other coach, simply
insisted that we should know by heart a very bad text-book, on
which he cross-examined us as we walked round the Botanic
Garden.&nbsp; As far as my recollection goes he never stopped to
show us a flower or a leaf, and we had nobody to help us to a
sight of the minute structure of plants as seen with a
microscope, about which, however, we could talk eloquently from
the book.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder that fire did not descend from heaven and
destroy a University which so sinned against the first elements
of knowing, in neglecting the distinction between what we learn
by our own personal experience and what we acquire from
books.</p>
<p>Of course there are some sciences which have their origin in
practical matters, <i>e.g.</i>, chemistry, which originated
partly in alchemy and partly in what is now the work of the
druggist; such a science was fortunate, in that no one objected
to its claim for practical teaching.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
student of chemistry in my day easily fell into a lamentable
dulness of different coloured precipitates.&nbsp; I should have
liked to do something quantitative, however rough, to get away
from the <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>everlasting test-tube, and to make,
for instance, some of the historic experiments with gases.</p>
<p>Human anatomy again was always taught practically,
<i>i.e.</i>, by work in the dissecting-room.&nbsp; But owing to
the manner in which medical students were examined, the subject
failed to have the value it might have had; minute questions were
asked which no amount of dissecting would enable us to
answer.&nbsp; The book had to be learned by heart, and I shudder
as I remember the futile labour entailed.&nbsp; And the
examination was so arranged, that whilst we were
&ldquo;cramming&rdquo; anatomy we had also to suffer over another
subject, materia medica, which was almost entirely useless, and
wearisome beyond belief.&nbsp; Much of it was about as rational a
subject to a physician as to a surgeon would be a minute
knowledge of how his knives were made and how steel is
manufactured.&nbsp; I remember how, after getting through this
double ordeal of cram on drugs and on the structure of the body,
I heard a surgeon say in lecture: &ldquo;This is one of the very
few occasions on which you must know your anatomy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
recall the anger and contempt I then felt for the educational
authorities, as I remembered the drudgery I had gone through.</p>
<p>The want of organised practical work in zoology was perhaps a
blessing in disguise.&nbsp; For it led me to struggle with the
subject by myself.&nbsp; I used to get snails and slugs and
dissect their dead bodies, comparing my results with books hunted
up in the University Library, and this was a real bit of
education.&nbsp; I remember too that a thoughtful brother sent me
a dead porpoise, which (to the <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>best of my
belief) I dissected, to the horror of the bedmaker, in my College
rooms.</p>
<p>Then the late Mr. Clark, superintendent of the Museum of
Zoology, and one of the kindest of men, occasionally gave us
beasts to cut up.&nbsp; I shall never forget my pride of heart
when a preparation which I made of a hedgehog&rsquo;s inside was
placed in the Museum.</p>
<p>Just as I was leaving Cambridge in 1869 or &rsquo;70 there
arrived that great man, Sir Michael Foster, who organised the
revolution in which the futilities of the early 19th century were
blown to fragments, and in their place a sound system of
practical instruction was created.&nbsp; Foster was discovered by
Huxley, and it was through him, and thanks to the patriotism of
Trinity College in creating for him the post of Praelector, that
Foster got this great opportunity.&nbsp; The effect of what he
did for English education has been incalculably great.&nbsp; His
pupils have gone forth into all lands, and have spread the art of
learning and teaching wherever they have come to rest.</p>
<p>In thinking over the reformation wrought by Michael Foster I
am somehow&mdash;quite inconsistently&mdash;reminded of the great
scene in <i>Guy Mannering</i>.&nbsp; I see in imagination the
cold dark cave at Warroch Head, where Dirk Hatteraick lurks; he
plays the part of False Science in the Mystery Play, and the cave
is the Cave of Inanity.&nbsp; Then comes the great flare of
light, as Meg Merrilees throws the torch on to the heap of flax,
and her cry, &ldquo;The hour is come and the man!&rdquo; while
Harry Bertram with his supporters rush in and bind False Science
fast.&nbsp; <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Harry Bertram is, of course, Michael
Foster, and I should say that Dandie Dinmont is Coutts
Trotter.&nbsp; Meg Merrilees is naturally Huxley, who was the
magician of the affair (she is always said to have looked like a
man).&nbsp; Here all analogy breaks down.&nbsp; Meg was killed by
False Science, Huxley was not; indeed it was the other way.&nbsp;
Harry Bertram lived happily ever afterwards.&nbsp; Michael Foster
was not so fortunate, and I am ashamed to think that before he
died he was misunderstood and half forgotten in his own
University.</p>
<p>I must apologise for this outburst of incoherence; I am afraid
it was not this sort of thing that Tyndall had in mind when he
pleaded for the scientific imagination&mdash;that is something
much more serious.</p>
<p>Not only does the student of to-day get good practical
teaching, but he has the great advantage of being under
professors who are generally engaged in original work.&nbsp; And
if a man can afford the time to stay up after his degree, he is
encouraged and helped to undertake research.&nbsp; If practical
teaching is the foundation, the protoplasm as it were, of
scientific education, I am sure that original work is its soul or
spirit.</p>
<p>Whether, like my father in South America, we have the genius
to solve big problems in geology and &ldquo;can hardly sleep at
night for thinking of them,&rdquo; or whether, as with us smaller
people, the task is some elusive little point which we
triumphantly track to its cause, there is an extraordinary
delight in such work.&nbsp; Professor Seward arranged an
admirable imitation of original research in his <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>advanced
class on the anatomy of plants at Cambridge.&nbsp; He gave out
specimens which the students had never seen; these had to be
investigated, and they had to give <i>viva voce</i> accounts of
their discoveries to the rest of the class.&nbsp; I believe this
to be a method worth imitating, and I may say as an encouragement
to women teachers that it was a Newnham student who was
especially distinguished in this mutual instruction class.</p>
<p>When I left Cambridge and became a medical student in London,
I had the luck to work in the laboratory of Dr. Klein, who was
then head of the Brown Institute at Nine Elms.&nbsp; He was fresh
from Vienna, with all the continental traditions in favour of
original research.&nbsp; Even in the ordinary laboratory work I
remember how he tried to throw the romance of practicality over
my task.&nbsp; He rushed in one day with a large bread-knife
stained with blood in the most sinister manner, saying that a
murder had occurred in South Lambeth, and it was for me to
determine whether or no the red fluid on the blade was blood!</p>
<p>Later on he set me to work investigating inflammation, and I
can still remember his praise of the harmless little paper I
wrote.&nbsp; To my secret satisfaction he blamed me for the
severity of my remarks on a German Professor who had written on
the subject.&nbsp; He told me to strike out my criticism, though
he allowed it to be just.&nbsp; I sighed as an author, but obeyed
as a pupil,&mdash;to misquote the words of Gibbon.</p>
<p>Education is often spoken of, and is praised or blamed, as a
method of imparting information to <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the
young.&nbsp; It is obvious that it is far more than this.&nbsp;
It includes the stimulation of tastes, tendencies, or instincts
which are inherent but dormant in the pupil.&nbsp; In my case the
opportunity, so wisely and kindly given by Dr. Klein, of seeing
science in the making&mdash;of seeing research from the
inside&mdash;his giving me the delight of knowing that I had
added a minute fragment to the great raging flood of publications
which marks the progress of knowledge&mdash;all this was a potent
factor in my education in the wider sense.&nbsp; That is, it did
not merely teach me certain facts, but woke in me the desire to
work at science for its own sake.&nbsp; My father finally gave me
the necessary opportunity by taking me as his assistant.</p>
<p>No one should ever be able to finish the history of his own
education, because it is co-extensive with his life.&nbsp; In my
father&rsquo;s autobiography written shortly before his death, he
attempts to sum up the effect of this self-education on himself,
both as concerns his experimental research and also in regard to
the literary part of his work.&nbsp; An instance of his modest
estimate of his own mental progress, is so characteristic that I
shall venture to quote it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think that I have
become a little more skilful in guessing right explanations and
in devising experimental tests; but this may probably be the
result of mere practice, and of a larger store of
knowledge.&nbsp; I have as much difficulty as ever in expressing
myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty has caused me a
very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating
advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>sentence, and thus I have been led to see errors in
reasoning and in my own observations or those of
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; I repeat that self-education is an endless
task.&nbsp; To some men this is a comforting, to others a
depressing, fact.&nbsp; Samuel Johnson was, I think, saddened by
the making of fresh plans of conduct for each new year.&nbsp; A
very different man, though also a Samuel,&mdash;Butler, the
author of <i>Erewhon</i>, was cheered by the thought that it was
always possible to improve.&nbsp; When I knew him he was working
as a painter in an untidy room in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, without
much furniture except a piano.&nbsp; He was poor, and therefore,
to save models, painted himself over and over again, the result
being a cupboard full of grim heads, which he called the chamber
of horrors.&nbsp; He always believed he should succeed at last,
and the point I am slowly reaching is that he comforted himself
with the belief that John Bellini entirely altered his style when
he was between 60 and 70 years of age.&nbsp; One of the French
aphorism writers, Vauvenargues, has said (as translated by Lord
Morley), &ldquo;To do great things a man must live as though he
had never to die.&rdquo; <a name="citation94"></a><a
href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a>&nbsp; I too would
recommend the wholesome theory that it is never too late to
learn; it helps to keep one from falling too soon into incurable
fogeydom.</p>
<p>In the lives of big men it is sometimes possible to see how
work done for its own sake may turn out to have had its real
value as a piece of training for something of far greater
worth.&nbsp; Thus my father <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>began in 1846
working at a curious Cirripede, <i>i.e.</i>, a barnacle, which he
had found on his voyage; this led him to examine others, and in
the end he worked seven or eight years at this group of
animals.</p>
<p>To his children the habit of working at barnacles seemed a
commonplace human function, like eating or breathing, and it is
reported that one of us being taken into the study of a
neighbour, and seeing no dissecting table or microscope, asked
with justifiable suspicion, &ldquo;Then where does he do his
barnacles?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I was writing my father&rsquo;s
<i>Life</i>, I asked Mr. Huxley his opinion whether this seven or
eight years&rsquo; work had been, in his judgment, worth the
great labour involved.&nbsp; His answer was that no man is a good
judge of the speculative strain which may be put on the raw
materials of science, unless he knows at first hand how this raw
material is acquired, and this knowledge my father gained by his
barnacles.&nbsp; The <i>Origin of Species</i> is the evidence
that he did not miscalculate the strain his facts would bear, for
his theory is as strong as ever.</p>
<p>There is one influence, of the greatest importance in regard
to education, with which I have not attempted to deal.&nbsp; I
mean the personal influence of the teacher.&nbsp; This is a part
of the pupil&rsquo;s environment which not even a millionaire can
undertake to supply to his pet University.&nbsp; It is rather a
thing to pray for, and to treasure when the gods send it to
us.</p>
<p>There is a magic in the personal effect of a great teacher,
which makes it comparatively unimportant <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>what sort of
science he teaches.&nbsp; In him the How entirely dwarfs the
What.</p>
<p>To take an instance.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s master, Professor
Henslow, was of this type.&nbsp; But some of his advice was
extremely bad.&nbsp; Thus he told my father to read Lyell&rsquo;s
<i>Principles</i>, but on no account to believe the theoretical
parts of the book.&nbsp; In spite of the warning, my father was
at once converted to the doctrines set forth in the
<i>Principles</i>, and Lyell was from that time forward the chief
influence of his scientific life.&nbsp; But his gratitude to
Henslow remained fresh and strong to the day of his death.</p>
<p>The same thing is true of Lyell and his instructors.&nbsp;
When he left Oxford and went down to Scotland geologising, he
must have been full of Buckland&rsquo;s teaching, and ought to
have believed that the surface of the county of Forfar was just
as the Flood left it, some few thousand years ago.&nbsp; But he
at once proceeded to discover in Noachian Forfarshire the most
striking evidence of geological change actually in
progress.&nbsp; So that, under the influence of a great
catastrophist, Lyell became the greatest of the uniformitarians,
and more than any one man was the destroyer of the older point of
view.</p>
<p>The personal effect of teacher on pupil cannot be bought at a
price, nor can it be paid for in any coin but gratitude.&nbsp; It
is the possibility of earning this payment that makes the best
part of a teacher&rsquo;s life.</p>

THE PIPE AND TABOR</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">An Address to a Society Of Morris
Dancers, Oxford, February 12, 1914</p>
<p>In the following pages I have brought together some scattered
information on the instruments, especially connected with
Folk-Dancing, which give the title to my address.&nbsp; The
coming to life of a mass of beautiful tunes and dances, in
response to the patient search of Mr. Cecil Sharp and a few
others, is one of the most magical occurrences of which I have
any memory.&nbsp; In a less degree I have experienced the same
sense of the unexpected, in learning that in a Kentish village,
so near London as often to be darkened by the skirts of town
fogs, the ancient superstition still existed of telling the bees
that their master is dead.&nbsp; Such an unsuspected lurking of
primitive belief in our midst may well give a shock of
surprise.&nbsp; But in the resurrection of the mass of hidden
music, and of the dying traditions of dances, a web of
extraordinary beauty is suddenly revealed&mdash;a matter of real
importance.</p>
<p>If tunes have souls they are shut out by death from ever again
vibrating in a human tenement.&nbsp; They are like the
<i>gabel-rachels</i>, the souls of unbaptised infants whom men in
Yorkshire used to hear crying round the church as though begging
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>to be let in.&nbsp; But the traditional tunes of England
are no longer homeless; they have a safe refuge in the printed
page.&nbsp; They have become immortal, or as near immortality as
modern paper can insure.</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp has done wonderful things; he is like a naturalist
who should discover that we are unconsciously surrounded by whole
races of beautiful things as unknown to us as elves and
fairies.&nbsp; In the Commemoration Service we speak gratefully
of all those who &ldquo;found out musical tunes.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
ever a man deserved remembrance for literally finding out tunes
it is Mr. Sharp.</p>
<p>But to return to the musical instruments of the Morris
dancers&mdash;the Pipe and Tabor.&nbsp; I am told that the little
drum on which the piper accompanies his tune should be pronounced
&lsquo;tabber.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have no doubt this is right.&nbsp;
The Oxfordshire name Dub suggests it, and the old French word
Tabour is something of an argument in the same direction.&nbsp;
In Wright&rsquo;s <i>Dialect Dictionary</i> it is said that the
lesser spotted woodpecker is called the &ldquo;tabberer&rdquo;
from its habit of drumming on tree trunks.&nbsp; I should like to
call my pipe a &ldquo;tabberer&rsquo;s&rdquo; pipe if only out of
affection for the little black and white bird and his drum, but
the modern pronunciation, with a long <i>a</i>, has a strong hold
and can hardly be ousted.&nbsp; We nowadays put the pipe before
the tabor, but in Shakespearian days this was not so.&nbsp; In
<i>The Tempest</i> Ariel plays the tune &ldquo;Flout &rsquo;em
and scout &rsquo;em&rdquo; on a tabor and pipe&mdash;and the
artist was called a taborer <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a> not a piper.&nbsp;
In the same way <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the Proven&ccedil;al performer on the
two instruments was (according to Daudet), and I hope still is,
known as the tabourinaire.</p>
<p>Morris dancing, for which the tabor and pipe once supplied the
music, is now an everyday accomplishment.&nbsp; At Cambridge one
may see Fellows of Colleges dancing, waving handkerchiefs and
knocking sticks in the old manner, and I hope the same is true of
Oxford.</p>
<p>But piping is not so common.&nbsp; Some of us have heard Mr.
Sharp at a lecture, or Mr. Haydn Coffin on the stage.&nbsp; But
it is not an art likely to spread rapidly, because the old
English is pipe rare and hard to come by, and copies are not
common either.</p>
<p>I began to learn the taborer&rsquo;s art on a French or Basque
galoubet obtained in Oxford from that kind friend of many
musicians, the late Mr. Taphouse.&nbsp; But it was only quite
recently, when Mr. Manning lent me an old Oxfordshire instrument
and allowed me to have it copied, that I made any kind of
progress.</p>
<p>I do not know when playing the &ldquo;whittle and dub&rdquo;
(as they were called) became extinct as a village art.&nbsp; It
certainly existed thirty years ago, and for all I know there are
still some living who could hand on the grand manner of
taboring.&nbsp; Mr. Taphouse remembered very well the days when
the pipe and drum were heard all round Oxford at fairs and
village festivals.&nbsp; I remember his showing me a whittle with
a crack in it where it had been broken over the head of a
reveller by a drunken taborer.</p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>The two instruments have been generally associated with
dancing.&nbsp; Tans&rsquo;ur, <a name="citation100a"></a><a
href="#footnote100a" class="citation">[100a]</a> writing in 1772,
speaks of this.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Tabor and Pipe are two musical
Instruments that always accompany each other, and are mostly used
at Wakes by Country People, and at their Dancings and innocent
Diversions, and often with Morris Dancers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaks
of the pipe as played with the left hand, &ldquo;on which Wrist
hangs a small drum, braced in Tune to the Pipe, and beat by the
Right Hand as a Bass in Time to it: both of which being well
managed make pretty Harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Wallace Collection there is a picture by N. Lancret
(1690&ndash;1743) of a celebrated dancer, Mme. Camargo, who is
accompanied by a small orchestra of two recorders, a bassoon and
one or more viols; these are partly hidden at the back of the
scene, while a boy with pipe and tabor <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> stands close to the dancer, giving
the impression that she depends on him rather than on the more
formal musicians in the background.&nbsp; It may remind us of the
Duke of Plaza Toro, who sings a song accompanied and supported by
his own particular private drum as well as by the
orchestra.&nbsp; The same quasi independence of the tabor and
pipe is still to be found in the folk music of the Catalans, the
inhabitants of the north-east of Spain.&nbsp; The dance <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>which Mr. Casals&mdash;himself a
Catalan&mdash;described to me, is a round dance of some
complexity.&nbsp; It is held in high esteem as a national affair,
and is danced by gentle and simple together.&nbsp; The band
consists of a tabor and pipe, four large rustic oboes, some
cornets and a double-bass.&nbsp; The interesting point is that
the taborer always leads off with a solo, a spirited flourish
which Mr. Casals was so good as to play on the piano.&nbsp; It is
curious that there is only one such traditional flourish, and
this is used whatever the dance-music may be.&nbsp; Mr. Casals
described the effect of the whole band as moving and exciting in
a high degree.</p>
<p>I have an old newspaper cutting of the Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert watching the British sailor dance a hornpipe on the
deck of a man-of-war, accompanied by a couple of marines with a
drum and fife.&nbsp; Shakespeare evidently considered these two
instruments as the military equivalent of the tabor and
pipe.&nbsp; He makes Benedick laugh at Claudio, in love, for
throwing over the drum and fife for the taborer&rsquo;s
music.</p>
<p>In the middle ages the tabor and pipe were a good deal
associated with the performances of strollers and
mountebanks.&nbsp; On the other hand, they did not always take
this role.&nbsp; There is a beautiful carved figure playing the
pipe and tabor in the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral, dating
from 1270.&nbsp; In Strutt&rsquo;s <i>Sports and Pastimes</i>
(Ed. 2, Plate XXIV), a horse is shown, dancing to a tabor and
pipe, from a MS. of about 1300; on Plate XXIII is a drawing of a
taboring hare (without a pipe) of about the end of the 13th
century.&nbsp; I am not <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>aware that
these instruments are known to have existed in England earlier
than the 13th century.</p>
<p>Fra Angelico puts these instruments into the hands of an
angelic lady.&nbsp; Her tabor is beautifully given, the pipe is
but slightly indicated.&nbsp; In Florence, among the singing boys
of Luca della Robbia (reproduced in fig. 5), is to be found the
best representation of a pipe player that I have seen.&nbsp;
There is a comparatively modern picture of Will Kemp, <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a> the Shakespearian actor, performing
his dance to Norwich.&nbsp; He started, apparently in 1599, on
the &ldquo;first Monday in cleane Lent,&rdquo; and succeeded in
his object, though not without difficulty.&nbsp; His
attendants&rsquo; names are pleasant: Taborer, Tom Slye, Servant,
Wm. Bee, Overseer, Geo. Sprat.</p>
<p>I am glad to say that a tabor and pipe appear in one very
honourable secular affair, <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a> namely, a
tournament, more correctly a joust or single combat.&nbsp; One of
the combatants is supported by a bagpipe, the other by a tabor
and pipe.&nbsp; It must be confessed, however, that the taborer
was not well treated in mediaeval times, badly paid, and not
received with the honour given to minstrels.</p>

<p>I like the rustic character of the pipe, and its association
with cheerful mediaeval vagabonds, and, still more, its memories
of centuries of village dances.&nbsp; I wish it had found a place
in that &ldquo;dancing in the chequered shade,&rdquo; in which
Milton <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>has immortalised the jocund
rebecks.&nbsp; But Milton was a player of the bass viol, and does
not show any especial feeling for wind instruments, so at least I
gather from Welch&rsquo;s interesting book. <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a></p>
<p>The taborer&rsquo;s pipe is a whistle; it happens to be made
of wood, but its musical structure is precisely that of the penny
whistle, except in one important particular, that it has but
three holes in place of six.&nbsp; The pipe is therefore a poor
relation of that beautiful but extinct instrument the
<i>recorder</i> <a name="citation103b"></a><a
href="#footnote103b" class="citation">[103b]</a> which is only a
wooden whistle.&nbsp; The recorder has a low, hollow, but most
effective tone, and I shall never forget the ravishing effect of
a quartet of recorders as played at a concert given by Mr.
Galpin, the well-known authority on old English
instruments.&nbsp; The taborer&rsquo;s pipe has none of the
sweetness of the recorder; it is essentially a shrill instrument;
indeed, I am told by a philologist that its old German name
<i>Schwegel</i> contains a root implying shrillness.&nbsp;
Another old German name is <i>Stamentien Pfeiffe</i>, which my
philological friend tells me does not occur in the best German
dictionary, and is of unknown origin.</p>
<p>As I have said, the pipe has but three holes (stopped by the
index, middle finger and thumb); these give four fundamental
tones, which however do not occur in the working scale of the
instrument.&nbsp; <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>In the penny whistle, and most
wood-wind instruments, the octave or first harmonic gives the
means of extending the scale.&nbsp; But in the taborer&rsquo;s
pipe the whole of the workable scale consists of harmonics; what
corresponds to the lower octave in the penny whistle&mdash;the
non-harmonic or fundamental part of the register&mdash;can only
be faintly sounded.&nbsp; It is the first harmonic or octave of
the lowest of these faint notes that forms the bottom note of the
scale of the three-holed pipe. <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; This note
is approximately D of the modern flat pitch.&nbsp; By
successively raising the middle and index fingers and then the
thumb, E, F, and G are sounded.&nbsp; Then all the finger holes
are again closed, and by a little extra impulse given to the
breath A is sounded, being the harmonic 5th of the lower D.&nbsp;
Then follow B and C as harmonic 5ths of E and F, and the final D
as the octave of the lowest tone.&nbsp; Above this a variable
number of notes&mdash;about four&mdash;are producible by
cross-fingerings.&nbsp; The ordinary work-a-day scale of the
taborer&rsquo;s pipe corresponds to the 12 or 13 uppermost notes
of a seven octave P-F., or to the upper notes of a piccolo.&nbsp;
The galoubet&rsquo;s scale begins on a B flat one-third below the
taborer&rsquo;s pipe.&nbsp; There was also a bass galoubet.&nbsp;
This instrument is known from the figures in Praetorius <a
name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a> (1618), and also from one solitary
pipe which has <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>escaped destruction.&nbsp; Mr.
Galpin has a copy of it in his wonderful collection, and has
allowed me to play on it. <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a></p>
<p>Mersenne, <a name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a> in speaking of the performance of an
Englishman, John Price, may give to some unwary reader the
impression that the said John could play a continuous scale of
three octaves.&nbsp; But it is quite clear that Mersenne included
the faint D an octave below the lowest harmonic note, so that
Price could produce an <i>interval</i> of three octaves but a
continuous <i>scale</i> of only two octaves.&nbsp; This is not
impossible.&nbsp; I can play two out-of-tune shrieking notes
above my high A, or 12th note, so that I can, after a fashion,
get within one note of John Price, and I live in hopes of
acquiring yet another and tying with him.&nbsp; The uppermost
sounds are made by what was technically known as <i>pinching</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> crooking the thumb and forcing the nail into the top
hole, so that only a minute stream of air escapes.&nbsp; An old
pipe of mine shows the mark of the pinching thumb nail.&nbsp; Mr.
Forsyth speaks of &ldquo;an instrument with only a few
notes&rdquo; as being &ldquo;much restricted in the way of
compass&rdquo;: <a name="citation105c"></a><a
href="#footnote105c" class="citation">[105c]</a> this is not
quite just to the taborer&rsquo;s pipe.</p>
<p>In relation to Mr. Forsyth&rsquo;s discussion on the
<i>diauloi</i>, it should be remembered that the double pipe
still exists in Russia.&nbsp; It is described <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>by Mahillon
<a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a> under the name of the
Gela&iuml;ka.&nbsp; The fundamental tones of the two instruments
are the lower F sharp in the treble stave, and the B natural
above it.&nbsp; Mahillon adds: &ldquo;tantot elles se partagent
la m&eacute;lodie, d&rsquo;autres fois elles font entendre des
intonations doubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to the Greek double-pipe, I am sure that Mr.
Forsyth is right, and that the bandage (<i>phorbeia</i>), which
is commonly said to have served to compress the cheeks, must have
had some other use.&nbsp; I have no doubt that he is justified in
assuming that the bandage served to support the instrument.&nbsp;
In a pipe with three holes on the upper surface a certain amount
of grip on the instrument is given by pressure of the little
finger above and the thumb below, and with practice it would be
quite possible to manage the instrument.&nbsp; Still, the bandage
would give freedom to the fingers, and for the four-holed pipe
this form of support would be absolutely necessary.&nbsp; My
conclusions are based on experiments on the penny whistle
temporarily converted into an instrument for one hand.</p>
<p>In speculating on the evolution of the taborer&rsquo;s pipe,
it must be remembered that its harmonics (on which, as I have
said, its scale depends) are those of a cylindrical pipe, and a
pipe that is long in relation to its bore.&nbsp; I like to think
that it had its origin in some of the many natural hollow
cylinders found among plants, for instance, the reed grass that
grows in fens and dykes, or the elder which supplies a pipe when
its pith is bored out, and is <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>perhaps
more familiar as the parent of pop-guns than of musical
instruments.&nbsp; Then again, there are the hollow stalks of
umbelliferous plants, such as angelica and hemlock.&nbsp; The
late Mr. Welch, in his interesting book on Recorders, pointed out
<a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a> that <i>sambucus</i> the elder,
<i>calamus</i> the reed, and <i>cicuta</i> the hemlock all occur
in classic verse in relation to rustic music.&nbsp; Indeed the
word calamus still lives, though corrupted to the French
chalumeau and still further altered to the German Schalmei and
the English shawm.</p>
<p>Welch doubts whether hemlock or similar stems would be strong
enough for the suggested purpose.&nbsp; They certainly would not
stand rough usage, but it is possible to make a taborer&rsquo;s
pipe out of an <i>Angelica</i> stem, for I have one.&nbsp; It is
husky and out of tune, but it shows the thing to be possible.</p>
<p>This connexion between music and the form of plants is not
without interest from a wider point of view.&nbsp; We ask
ourselves why hollow cylinders occur so commonly in vegetable
architecture.&nbsp; That rough teacher, the struggle for life,
has taught plants that a tube is, mechanically speaking, the best
way of arranging a limited amount of formative or building
material.&nbsp; The hemlock or the reed can thus make stalks of
ample strength and at comparatively slight cost.&nbsp; There is
romance in the fact that plants made tubular stems to their own
private profit for unnumbered ages before the coming of man: the
hollow reeds waiting all these aeons till Pan should come and
make them musical.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>The pipe and tabor have probably come down to us less
changed than any other wood-wind instrument, with the possible
exception of the panpipes; both flutes and flageolets have become
covered with keys, while the pipe still has no more than three
aboriginal holes, one for the thumb behind and two for the
fingers in front.&nbsp; I have wasted some time in trying to make
out how the early taborers held their pipes, but musical
instruments are generally drawn with hopeless inaccuracy.&nbsp; I
have been rewarded by finding that a boy in Luca della
Robbia&rsquo;s bas-relief (Fig. 5) at Florence holds the pipe
just as I do, <a name="citation108a"></a><a href="#footnote108a"
class="citation">[108a]</a> between the ring and little fingers,
which keep the instrument steady even when all three holes are
uncovered.&nbsp; There is an interesting point connected with the
true or French flageolet.&nbsp; This instrument has six holes
arranged in two triads, a thumb and two fingers of the right
hand, and the same for the left, so that if all holes are open
there would seem to be nothing to steady the pipe.&nbsp; But in
Mr. Welch&rsquo;s book (p. 50) is a figure from Greeting&rsquo;s
<i>Pleasant Companion </i><a name="citation108b"></a><a
href="#footnote108b" class="citation">[108b]</a> showing how the
flageolet <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>should be held, and this, curiously
enough, is one of the best views of what I hold to be the proper
grip for the taborer&rsquo;s pipe.</p>
<p>The tabor is still much as it was in Fra Angelico&rsquo;s day
(judging from the angel above referred to), and indeed in earlier
times, as shown in the piping angel in Lincoln Cathedral.&nbsp;
We can see what a drum-maker calls the ropes and braces <a
name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a"
class="citation">[109a]</a> for tightening the parchment; the
snares are also shown in many early drawings of tabors.&nbsp;
These are pieces of gut or of horse-hair, stretched across the
drum-head, which add a spirited rattle to its tone.&nbsp; Why the
first edition of the <i>Dictionary of Music</i> went out of its
way to say that the tabor had no snares I cannot guess.</p>
<p>In many of the mediaeval drawings the artist is shown beating
his drum on the snare side.&nbsp; I had fancied that this was
only one more instance of the bad drawing of musical instruments,
but when I saw the careful work of Luca della Robbia, in which
the tabors are all beaten on the snare side, I could no longer
doubt.&nbsp; I was, however, glad to find in a French account <a
name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b"
class="citation">[109b]</a> of the Proven&ccedil;al 3-holed pipe
or galoubet, that this custom survives.&nbsp; In Luca della
Robbia&rsquo;s work a single snare-cord is shown instead of four
to six catgut lines as in modern drums and this is also true of
the Proven&ccedil;al instrument.&nbsp; So that both the
characteristics that seemed strange to me in Luca&rsquo;s tabor
survive in Provence.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>It may not be generally known that the French for the
snare of a drum is <i>timbre</i>; this is the original meaning of
the word, and its familiar use to mean the characteristic tone of
a musical sound is later.&nbsp; According to Darmstetter the word
&lsquo;timbre&rsquo; is own brother to &lsquo;tambour,&rsquo;
both being derived from a low Latin form of tympanum.</p>
<p>The tabor-stick has changed since the early centuries.&nbsp;
In some of the old drawings the taborer is striking his
instrument with a bludgeon, instead of the light and elegant
sticks such as are to be seen in Mr. Manning&rsquo;s collection
at Oxford.&nbsp; Such implements were doubtless treasured by the
taborer.&nbsp; Valmajour, the tabourinaire in Daudet&rsquo;s
<i>Numa Roumestan</i>, possessed a drum-stick which had been in
the family for 200 years.</p>
<p>The way of holding the drum has not always been the
same.&nbsp; Nowadays we are told to hang it from the thumb or
wrist.&nbsp; But in many early drawings it is apparently firmly
strapped or tied to the forearm, or even above the elbow. <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a>&nbsp; The Lincoln Angel and
Luca&rsquo;s boy have tabors supported by a string round the
neck, and this I find to be the best method.</p>
<p>I hope that the drum may long survive in Provence with its
ancient companion the pipe. <a name="citation110b"></a><a
href="#footnote110b" class="citation">[110b]</a>&nbsp; A
different instrument, however, supplies an accompaniment to the
galoubet in the Basque provinces.&nbsp; It is a rough sort of
lyre with six or <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>seven strings tuned alternately to
the tonic and dominant, which beaten with a stick make a drone
bass to the pipe.&nbsp; It has the attractively savage name of
<i>toon-toona</i>, an imitative word like tom-tom; the galoubet
is called the <i>cherula</i>.</p>
<p>From a French cyclop&aelig;dia I learn that in Provence the
taborer&rsquo;s art was a secret passed on from father to son, a
mystery they refused to teach for money.&nbsp; They appeared to
hold the patriotic opinion that the art of playing the galoubet,
or as they call it, the <i>fl&ucirc;tet</i>, has never spread
from Provence because of its extreme difficulty.&nbsp; This has
been a comfort to me in my attempts to play the pipe and
tabor.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX I<br />
DRAWINGS AND CARVINGS OF PIPERS</h3>
<p>At the risk of being tedious in the way of repetition I have
thought it worth while to put together a rough list of the
illustrations of pipe and tabor which I have met with.</p>
<p>The earliest representation of a player on the 3-holed pipe,
of which I have any knowledge, is the beautiful figure in the
Angel Choir at Lincoln.&nbsp; Its date is, I believe, 1270, and
it has been injured so that it is not possible to be sure of the
manner in which the pipe is held.&nbsp; The tabor is suspended by
means of a string round the neck.</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>The most careful representation of our instrument is
that by Luca della Robbia, figured at p. 102, in which what I
call the correct grip is given.</p>
<p>In Pierpoint Morgan&rsquo;s <i>Catalogue of Early Printed
Books</i>, Vol II., p. 118, are some illustrations from Gafori,
1492.&nbsp; The pipe is quite incorrectly held, more than two
fingers being employed while the thumb is free.</p>
<p><i>Ibid.</i>, Vol III., p. 82.&nbsp; In a figure from Pierre
Michaud&rsquo;s <i>Dance des Aveugles</i>, 1485, the pipe has
four instead of two holes on the upper surface.</p>
<p><i>Ibid.</i>, Vol III., p. 86.&nbsp; The pipe is incorrect,
the holes being too far from the lower end of the instrument; the
hand is wrongly given according to our standards, the little
finger being flourished in the air.&nbsp; The tabor is suspended
from the hand as in the English style, and is struck on the snare
side.</p>
<p>In Kemp&rsquo;s <i>Nine Daies Wonder</i> (see above p. 102)
the drawing of the pipe is not instructive.</p>
<p>In Strutt&rsquo;s <i>Sports and Pastimes</i> there are several
early drawings of performers on the 3-holed pipe.&nbsp; The grip
in the majority is correct, <i>i.e.</i> there are three fingers
visible, two covering the holes and the ring finger gripping
against the little finger underneath.&nbsp; The illustrations are
also correct in the fingers being close to the lower end of the
pipe.</p>
<p>In Betley Hall, Staffordshire, is a painted glass window,
probably dating from 1535, in which a piper is represented.&nbsp;
Mr. Tollet, a former squire of Betley, gave an account of it in
Johnson and Steevens&rsquo; Shakspeare, which is reprinted in a
privately published book by Barthomley.&nbsp; The pipe is a
conical tube, on which four fingers are <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>represented; it could not, I believe, have been drawn
from a model.</p>
<p>In Mahillon&rsquo;s <i>Catalogue</i> i., p. 375, is a figure
of a Basque playing a 3-holed pipe, and accompanying himself on
the tountouna, a rough stringed instrument.&nbsp; The grip seems
to be carefully drawn, but it is hard to see how it could be
efficient, only two fingers being seen on the upper surface of
the pipe.&nbsp; On the other hand, in a photograph of a Basque
playing the same instrument (which I owe to the kindness of a
correspondent), the grip is like that figured by Mahillon.</p>
<p>Finally, in <i>Punch</i>, November 13, 1907, a 3-holed pipe is
incorrectly drawn.&nbsp; The bore of the instrument is conical,
the holes are incorrectly given, and the hand is wrong.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX II<br />
THE FINGERING OF THE 3-HOLED PIPER</h3>
<p>The following diagram gives the fingerings which I have found
to be best for a 3-holed pipe, a copy of an old one in the
possession of Mr. Manning, of Oxford, to whom I am indebted for
much kindly assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>The fingerings are given for the keys D and G.&nbsp; I
have not attempted to play in other keys.&nbsp; For each note the
upper circle represents the thumbhole; 1 and 2 are for the first
and second fingers respectively.&nbsp; The black circles are
supposed to be closed, the white are open.&nbsp; Holes that are
half open are represented by circles half white, half
black.&nbsp; In the case of A2 and B2 the circles are
three-quarter black; this means that a very minute crack is left
open.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that each pipe has its
individuality.&nbsp; For instance, in one of my instruments G
must have the thumb hole completely open, and the alternate
fingering (with the index hole closed) is quite out of
tune.&nbsp; The note E is sometimes sharp; in the pipe, the
fingerings of which are given in fig. 6, this fault is corrected
by means of a thin metal lining to the lower hole.</p>

STEPHEN HALES <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a><br />
1677&ndash;1761</h2>
<p>In attempting to give a picture of any man&rsquo;s life and
work it is well to follow the rule of the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, and begin with the dates of his birth and
death.&nbsp; Stephen Hales was born in 1677 and died in 1761,
having had experiences of the reigns of seven sovereigns.</p>
<p>The authorities for his life are given in my article on Hales
in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.&nbsp; Botanists
in general probably take their knowledge of the main facts of his
life from Sachs&rsquo; <i>History of Botany</i>.&nbsp; It is
therefore worth while to point out that both the original and the
English translation (1890) contain the incorrect statement that
Hales was educated at Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and that
he held the living of Riddington, whereas he is one of the
glories of Corpus, and was perpetual curate of Teddington.&nbsp;
These inaccuracies, however, are trifles in relation to the great
and striking merits of Sachs&rsquo; <i>History</i>, a work which,
to my thinking, exhibits the strength and brilliance of the
author&rsquo;s mind as clearly as any of his more technical
writings.&nbsp; Sachs was no <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>niggling
biographer, and his broad vigorous outlines must form the basis
of what anyone, who follows him, can write about the botanists of
a past day.</p>
<p>To return to Hales&rsquo; birth.&nbsp; It is of interest to
note how he fits into the changing procession of lives, to see
what great men overlap his youth, who were his contemporaries in
his maturity, and who were appearing on the scientific stage as
he was leaving it.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton was the dominant figure in English science
while Hales was developing.&nbsp; He died in 1727, the year in
which Hales published his <i>Vegetable Staticks</i>, a book,
which like the <i>Origin of Species</i>, appeared when its author
was 50 years of age.&nbsp; Newton was at the zenith of his fame
when Hales was a little boy of 10&mdash;his <i>Principia</i>
having been published in 1687, and when Hales went up to
Cambridge in 1696 he must have seen the great man coming from his
rooms <a name="citation116a"></a><a href="#footnote116a"
class="citation">[116a]</a> in the N.E. corner of the Great Court
of Trinity&mdash;that corner where Newton&rsquo;s and other more
modern ghosts surely walk&mdash;Macaulay who used to read, pacing
to and fro by the chapel, <a name="citation116b"></a><a
href="#footnote116b" class="citation">[116b]</a> and Thackeray
who, like his own Esmond, lived &ldquo;near to the famous Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s lodgings.&rdquo;&nbsp; In any case there can be no
doubt that the genius of Newton cast its light on Hales, as Sachs
has clearly pointed out <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>(<i>Hist.
Bot.</i>, Eng. Tr., p. 477).&nbsp; Another great man influenced
Hales, namely Robert Boyle, who was born 1627 and died
1691.&nbsp; John Mayow again, that brilliant son of Oxford, whose
premature death at 39 in 1679 was so heavy a blow to science,
belongs to the same school as Hales&mdash;the school which was
within an ace of founding a rational chemistry, but which was
separated from the more obvious founders of that science by the
phlogiston-theory of Becchers and Stahl.&nbsp; I do not find any
evidence that Hales was influenced by the phlogistic writers, and
this is comprehensible enough, if, as I think, he belongs to the
school of Mayow and Boyle.</p>
<p>The later discoverers in chemistry are of the following dates,
Black 1728&ndash;1799, Cavendish 1731&ndash;1810, Priestley
1733&ndash;1804, Scheele 1742&ndash;1786, Lavoisier 1743,
guillotined 1794.&nbsp; These were all born about the time of
Hales&rsquo; zenith, nor did he live <a name="citation117"></a><a
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a> to see the great
results they accomplished.&nbsp; But it should not be forgotten
that Hales&rsquo; chemical work made more easy the triumphant
road they trod.</p>
<p>I have spoken of Hales in relation to chemists and physicists
because, though essentially a physiologist, he seems to me to
have been a chemist and physicist who turned his knowledge to the
study of life, rather than a physiologist who had some chemical
knowledge.</p>
<p>Whewell points out in his <i>History of the Inductive </i><!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span><i>Sciences</i> <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a> that the
physiologist asks questions of Nature in a sense differing from
that of the physicist.&nbsp; The <i>Why</i>? of the physicist
meant <i>Through what causes</i>? that of the
physiologist&mdash;<i>to what end</i>?&nbsp; This distinction no
longer holds good, and if it is to be applied to Hales it is a
test which shows him to be a physicist.&nbsp; For, as Sachs
shows, though Hales was necessarily a teleologist in the
theological sense, he always asked for purely mechanical
explanations.&nbsp; He was the most unvitalistic of
physiologists, and I think his explanations suffered from this
cause.&nbsp; For instance, he seems to have held that to compare
the effect of heat on a growing root to the action of the same
cause on a thermometer <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a> was a quite
satisfactory proceeding.&nbsp; And there are many other passages
in <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> where one feels that his
speculations are too heavy for his knowledge.</p>
<p>Something must be said of Hales&rsquo; relation to his
predecessors and successors in botanical work.&nbsp; The most
striking of his immediate predecessors were Malpighi
1628&ndash;1694, Grew 1628&ndash;1711, Ray 1627&ndash;1705, and
Mariotte (birth unknown, died 1684); and of these the three first
were born one hundred years before the publication of
<i>Vegetable Staticks</i>.&nbsp; Malpighi and Grew were
essentially plant-anatomists, though both dealt in physiological
speculations.&nbsp; Their works were known to Hales, but they do
not seem to have influenced him.</p>
<p>We have seen that as a chemist Hales is <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>somewhat of
a solitary figure, standing between what may be called the
periods of Boyle and of Cavendish.&nbsp; This is even more
striking in his botanical position, for here he stands in the
solitude of all great original inquirers.&nbsp; We must go back
to Van Helmont, 1577&ndash;1644, to find anyone comparable to him
as an experimentalist.&nbsp; His successors have discovered much
that was hidden from him; but consciously or unconsciously they
have all learned from him the true method and spirit of
physiological work.</p>
<p>It may be urged that in exalting Hales I am unfair to
Malpighi.&nbsp; It may be fairer to follow Sachs in linking these
great men together, and to insist on the wonderful fact that
before Malpighi&rsquo;s book in 1671, vegetable physiology was
still where Aristotle left it, whereas 56 years later, in 1727,
we find in Hales&rsquo; book an experimental science in the
modern sense.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that students of animal physiology
agree with botanists as to Hales&rsquo; greatness.&nbsp; A writer
in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> speaks of him as
&ldquo;the true founder of the modern experimental method in
physiology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Sachs, Ray made some interesting observations on
the transmission of water, but on the whole what he says on this
subject is not important.&nbsp; There is no evidence that Ray
influenced Hales.</p>
<p>Mariotte, the physicist, came to one physiological conclusion
of great weight; <a name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a> namely, that <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the
different qualities of plants, <i>e.g.</i> taste, odour, etc., do
not depend on the absorption from the soil of differently scented
or flavoured principles, as the Aristotelians imagined, but on
<i>specific differences</i> in the way in which different plants
deal with identical food material&mdash;an idea which is at the
root of a sane physiological outlook.&nbsp; These views were
published in 1679, <a name="citation120"></a><a
href="#footnote120" class="citation">[120]</a> and may have been
known to Hales.&nbsp; He certainly was interested in such ideas,
as is indicated by his attempts to give flavour to fruit by
supplying them with medicated fluids.&nbsp; He probably did not
expect success, for he remarks (p. 360): &ldquo;The specifick
differences of vegetables, which are all sustained and grow from
the same nourishment, is [<i>sic</i>] doubtless owing to the very
different formation of their minute vessels, whereby an almost
infinite variety of combinations of the common principles of
vegetables is made.&rdquo;&nbsp; He continues in the following
delightful passage: &ldquo;And could our eyes attain to a sight
of the admirable texture of the parts on which the specific
differences in plants depends, [<i>sic</i>] what an amazing and
beautiful scene of inimitable embroidery should we behold? what a
variety of masterly strokes of machinery? what evident marks of
consummate wisdom should we be entertained with?&rdquo;&nbsp; To
conclude what has been said on Hales&rsquo; chronological
position&mdash;Ingenhousz, the chief founder of the modern point
of view on plant nutrition, was born 1730 and published his book,
<i>On Vegetables</i>, etc., in 1779.&nbsp; <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>So that
what was said of Hales&rsquo; chemical position is again true of
him considered in relation to nutrition; he did not live to see
the great discoveries made at the close of the 18th century.</p>
<p>There is in his writing a limpid truthfulness and simplicity,
unconsciously decorated with pretty 18th century words and
half-rusticities which give it a perennial charm.&nbsp; And
inasmuch as I desire to represent Hales, not only as a man to be
respected but also to be loved, it will be as well to give what
is known of the personal side of his character before going on to
a detailed account of his work.</p>
<p>He was, as we have seen, entered at Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, in June 1696.&nbsp; In February 1702&ndash;3 he was
admitted a fellow of the College.&nbsp; It was during his life as
a fellow that he began to work at chemistry in what he calls
&ldquo;the elaboratory in Trinity College.&rdquo;&nbsp; The room
is now occupied by the Senior Bursar, and forms part of the
beautiful range of buildings in the bowling green, which, freed
from stucco and other desecration, are made visible in their
ancient guise by the piety of a son of Trinity and the wisdom of
the College authorities.&nbsp; It was here, according to Dr.
Bentley, that &ldquo;the thieving Bursars of the old set
embezzled the College timber,&rdquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a> and it was this
room that was fitted up as &ldquo;an elegant laboratory&rdquo; in
1706 for John Francis Vigani, an Italian chemist, who had taught
unofficially in the <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>University for some years, and
became, in 1703, the first Professor of Chemistry at
Cambridge.</p>
<p>Judging from his book, <i>Medulla Chymiae</i>, 1682, Vigani
was an eminently practical person, who cared greatly about the
proper make of a furnace and the form of a retort but was not
cumbered with theories.</p>
<p>Hales vacated his fellowship and became minister or perpetual
curate of Teddington <a name="citation122"></a><a
href="#footnote122" class="citation">[122]</a> in 1708&ndash;9,
and there he lived until his death, fifty-two years
afterwards.&nbsp; He was married (? 1719) and his wife died
without issue in 1721.</p>
<p>He attracted the attention of Royalty, and received plants
from the King&rsquo;s garden at Hampton Court.&nbsp; Frederick
Prince of Wales, the father of George III., is said to have been
fond of surprising him in his laboratory at Teddington.&nbsp;
This must surely be a unique habit in a prince, but we may
remember that, in the words of the Prince&rsquo;s mock epitaph,
&ldquo;Since it is only Fred there&rsquo;s no more to be
said.&rdquo;&nbsp; He became Clerk of the Closet to the Dowager
Princess, and this &ldquo;mother of the best of Kings,&rdquo; as
she calls herself, put up his monument in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; Hales had the honour of receiving the Copley Medal
from the Royal Society in 1739, and Oxford made him a D.D. in
1733.</p>
<p>Some years ago I made a pilgrimage to Teddington, and found in
the parish registers many interesting entries by his hand; the
last, in a tremulous writing, is on November 4th, 1760, two
months before he died.&nbsp; He was clearly an active parish <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>priest.&nbsp; He made his female parishioners do public
penance when he thought they deserved it.&nbsp; He did much for
the fabric of the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1754 <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a> he helped the parish to a decent
water supply and characteristically records in the parish
register that the outflow was such as to fill a two-quart vessel
in &lsquo;three swings of a pendulum beating seconds, which
pendulum was 39+2/10 inches long from the suspending nail to the
middle of the plumbet or bob.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Under the tower
he helped to build (which now serves as a porch) Stephen Hales is
buried, and the stone which covers his body is being worn away by
the feet of the faithful.&nbsp; By the piety of a few botanists a
mural tablet, on which the epitaph is restored, has been placed
near the grave.</p>
<p>Horace Walpole called Hales &ldquo;a poor, good, primitive
creature&rdquo; and Pope <a name="citation123b"></a><a
href="#footnote123b" class="citation">[123b]</a> (who was his
neighbour) said, &ldquo;I shall be very glad to see Dr. Hales,
and always love to see him, he is so worthy and good a
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter Collinson writes of &ldquo;his constant
serenity and cheerfulness of mind&rdquo;; it is also recorded
that &ldquo;he could look even upon wicked men, and those who did
him unkind offices, without any emotion of particular
indignation; not from want of discernment or sensibility, but he
used to consider them only like those experiments which, upon
trial, he found could never be applied to any useful purpose, and
which he therefore calmly and dispassionately laid
aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>Under No. I I shall deal only with his work on plants.&nbsp;
The last heading (No. III) I shall only refer to slightly, but
the variety and ingenuity of his miscellaneous publications is
perhaps worth mention here as an indication of the quality of his
mind.&nbsp; It seems to me to have had something in common with
the versatile ingenuity of Erasmus Darwin and of his grandson
Francis Galton.&nbsp; The miscellaneous work also exhibits Hales
as a philanthropist, who cared passionately for bettering the
health and comfort of his fellow creatures by improving their
conditions of life.</p>
<p>His chief book from the physiological and chemical point of
view is his <i>Vegetable Staticks</i>.&nbsp; It will be
convenient to begin with the physiological part of this book, and
refer to the chemistry later.&nbsp; <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> is
a small 8vo of 376 pages, dated on the title-page 1727.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;<i>Imprimatur</i> Isaac Newton Pr. Reg. Soc.&rdquo; is
dated February 16, 1720, and this date is of some slight
interest, for Newton died on March 20, and <i>Vegetable
Staticks</i> must have been one of the last books he signed.</p>
<p>The dedication is to George Prince of Wales, afterwards George
III.&nbsp; The author cannot quite avoid the style of his day,
for instance: &ldquo;And as <i>Solomon</i> the greatest and
wisest of men, disdeigned <a name="citation124"></a><a
href="#footnote124" class="citation">[124]</a> not to inquire
into the nature of Plants, <i>from the </i><!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span><i>Cedar of
Lebanon</i>, <i>to the Hyssop that springeth out of the wall</i>:
So it will not, I presume, be an unacceptable entertainment to
your Royal Highness,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>But the real interest of the dedication is its clear statement
of his views on the nutrition of plants.&nbsp; He asserts that
plants obtain nourishment, not only from the earth, &ldquo;but
also more sublimed and exalted food from the air, that wonderful
fluid, which is of such importance to the life of Vegetables and
Animals,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; We shall see that his later statement
is not so definite, and it is well to rescue this downright
assertion from oblivion.</p>
<p>His book begins with the research for which he is best known,
namely that on transpiration.&nbsp; He took a sunflower growing
in a flowerpot, covering the surface of the earth with a plate of
thin milled lead, and cemented it so that no vapour could pass,
leaving a corked hole to allow of the plant being watered.&nbsp;
He did not take steps to prevent loss through the pot, but at the
end of the experiment cut off the plant, cemented the stump, and
found that the &ldquo;unglazed porous pot&rdquo; perspired 2 ozs.
in 12 hours, and for this he made due allowance.</p>
<p>The plant so prepared he proceeded to weigh at stated
intervals.&nbsp; He obtained the area of the leaves by dividing
them into parcels according to their several sizes, and measuring
one leaf <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a> of each parcel.&nbsp; The loss of
water in 12 hours converted to the metric system is 1.3 c.c. per
100 sq. cm. of <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>leaf-surface; and this is of the
same order of magnitude as Sachs&rsquo; result, <a
name="citation126a"></a><a href="#footnote126a"
class="citation">[126a]</a> namely, 2.2 c.c. per 100 sq. cm.</p>
<p>He goes on to measure the surface of the roots <a
name="citation126b"></a><a href="#footnote126b"
class="citation">[126b]</a> and to estimate the rate of
absorption per area.&nbsp; The calculation is of no value, since
he did not know how small a part of the roots is absorbent, nor
how enormously the surface of that part is increased by the
presence of root-hairs.&nbsp; He goes on to estimate the rate of
the flow of water up the stem; this would be 34 cubic inches in
12 hours if the stem (which was one square inch in section) were
a hollow tube.&nbsp; He then allowed a sunflower stem to wither
and to become completely dry, and found that it had lost &frac34;
of its weight, and assuming that the &frac14; of the &ldquo;solid
parts&rdquo; left was useless for the transmission of water he
increases his 34 by &#8531; and gives 45&#8531; cubic inches in
12 hours as the rate.&nbsp; But the solid matter which he
neglected contained the vessels, and he would have been nearer to
the truth had he corrected his figures on this basis.&nbsp; The
simplest plan is to compare his results with those obtained by
Sachs <a name="citation126c"></a><a href="#footnote126c"
class="citation">[126c]</a> in allowing plants to absorb
solutions of lithium-salts.&nbsp; If the flow takes place through
conduits equivalent to a quarter of a square inch in area, the
fluid will rise in 12 hours to a height of 4+34 or 136 inches, or
in one hour to 28.3 cm. <a name="citation126d"></a><a
href="#footnote126d" class="citation">[126d]</a>&nbsp; This is a
result comparable to, though <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>very much
smaller than, Sachs&rsquo; result with the sunflower, viz. 63 cm.
per hour.</p>
<p>The data are however hardly worth treating in this
manner.&nbsp; But it is of historic interest to note that when
Sachs was at work on his <i>Pflanzenphysiologie</i>, published in
1865, he was compelled to go back nearly 140 years to find any
results with which he could compare his own.</p>
<p>We need not follow Hales into his comparison between the
&ldquo;perspiration&rdquo; of the sunflower and that of a man,
nor into his other transpiration experiments on the cabbage,
vine, apple, etc.&nbsp; But one or two points must be
noted.&nbsp; He found <a name="citation127a"></a><a
href="#footnote127a" class="citation">[127a]</a> the
&ldquo;middle rate of perspiration&rdquo; of a sunflower in 12
hours of daylight to be 20 ounces, and that of a &ldquo;dry warm
night&rdquo; about 3 ounces; thus the day transpiration was
roughly seven times the nocturnal rate.&nbsp; This difference may
be accounted for by the closure of the stomata at night, a
phenomenon unknown to Hales.</p>
<p>Hales <a name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a> notes another point which a knowledge
of stomatal behaviour might have explained, viz., that with
&ldquo;scanty watering the perspiration much abated&rdquo;; he
does not attempt an explanation, but merely refers to it as a
&ldquo;healthy latitude of perspiration in this
sunflower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of his work on sunflowers he notices that the
flower follows the sun.&nbsp; He says, however that it is
&ldquo;not by turning round with the sun,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> that
it is not a twisting of the stalk, and <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>goes on to
call it <i>nutation</i>, which must be the <i>locus classicus</i>
for the term used in this sense.</p>
<p>An experiment <a name="citation128a"></a><a
href="#footnote128a" class="citation">[128a]</a> that I do not
remember to have seen quoted elsewhere is worth describing.&nbsp;
It is incidentally of interest as showing the generous scale on
which his work was planned.&nbsp; An apple bough five feet long
was fixed to a vertical glass tube nine feet long.&nbsp; The tube
being above and the branch hanging below, the pressure of the
column of water would act in concert with the suck of the
transpiring leaves, instead of in opposition to this force.&nbsp;
He then cut the bare stem of his branch in two, placing the
apical half of the specimen (bearing side branches and leaves)
with its cut end in a glass vessel of water; the basal and
leafless half of the branch remained attached to the vertical
tube of water.&nbsp; In the next 30 hours only 6 ounces dripped
through the leafless branch, whereas the leafy branch absorbed 18
ounces.&nbsp; This, as he says, shows the great power of
perspiration.&nbsp; And though he does not pursue the experiment,
it is worthy of note as an attempt, like those of Janse <a
name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a> and others, to correlate the flow of
water under pressure with the flow due to transpiration.</p>
<p>It is interesting to find that Hales used the three methods of
estimating transpiration which have been employed in modern
times&mdash;namely, (i) weighing, (ii) a rough sort of potometer,
(iii) enclosing a branch in a glass balloon and collecting <!--
page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>the precipitated moisture, the well-known plan followed
by various French observers.</p>
<p>He (<i>Vegetable Staticks</i>, p. 51) concluded his balance of
loss and gain in transpiring plants by estimating the amount of
available water in the soil to a depth of three feet, and
calculating how long his sunflower would exist without
watering.&nbsp; He further concludes (p. 57) that an annual
rainfall of 22 inches is &ldquo;sufficient for all the purposes
of nature, in such flat countries as this about
Teddington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He constantly notes small points of interest, <i>e.g.</i> (p.
82) that with cut branches the water absorbed diminishes each
day, and that the former vigour of absorption may be partly
renewed by cutting a fresh surface. <a name="citation129a"></a><a
href="#footnote129a" class="citation">[129a]</a></p>
<p>He also showed (p. 89) that the transpiration current can flow
perfectly well from apex to base when the apical end is immersed
in water.</p>
<p>These are familiar facts to us, but we should realise that it
is to the industry and ingenuity of Hales that we owe them.&nbsp;
In a repetition (p. 90) of the last experiment we have the first
mention of a fact fundamentally important.&nbsp; He took two
branches (which with a clerical touch he calls M and N), and
having removed the bark from a part of the branch, dipped the
ends in water, N with the great end downwards but M upside
down.&nbsp; In this way he showed that the bark was not necessary
for the absorption or transmission of water. <a
name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a>&nbsp; I suspect <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>that one
branch was inverted out of respect for the hypothesis of
sap-circulation.&nbsp; He perhaps thought that water could travel
apically by the wood, but only by the bark in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>Next in order (p. 95) comes his well-known experiment on the
pressure exerted by peas increasing in size as they imbibe
water.&nbsp; There are, however, pitfalls in this result of which
Hales was unaware, and perhaps the chief interest to us now is
that he considered the imbibition of the peas <a
name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a"
class="citation">[130a]</a> to be the same order of phenomenon as
the absorption of water by a cut branch&mdash;notwithstanding the
fact that he knew the absorption to depend largely on the leaves.
<a name="citation130b"></a><a href="#footnote130b"
class="citation">[130b]</a>&nbsp; It may be noticed that Sachs,
in his imbibitional view of water-transport, may be counted a
follower of Hales.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain &ldquo;whether there was any lateral
communication of the sap and sap vessels, as there is of blood in
animals,&rdquo; Hales (p. 121) made the experiment which has been
repeated in modern laboratories, <a name="citation130c"></a><a
href="#footnote130c" class="citation">[130c]</a> <i>i.e.</i>
cutting a &ldquo;gap to the pith,&rdquo; and another opposite to
it and a few inches above.&nbsp; This he did on an oak branch six
feet long whose basal end was placed in water.&nbsp; The branch
continued to &ldquo;perspire&rdquo; for two days, but gave off
only about half the amount of water transpired by a normal
branch. <a name="citation130d"></a><a href="#footnote130d"
class="citation">[130d]</a>&nbsp; He does not trouble himself
about <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>this difference, being satisfied of
&ldquo;great quantities of liquor having passed laterally by the
gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is interested in the fact of lateral transmission in
connexion with the experiment of the suspended tree (Fig. 24, p.
126), which is dependent on the neighbours to which it is grafted
for its water supply.&nbsp; This seems to be one of the results
that convinced him that there is a distribution of food material
which cannot be described as circulation of sap in the sense that
was then in vogue.</p>
<p>Hales (p. 143) was one of the first <a
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a> to make the well-known
experiment&mdash;the removal of a ring of bark, with the result
that the edge of bark nearest the base of the branch swells and
thickens in a characteristic manner.&nbsp; He points out that if
a number of rings are made one above the other, the swelling is
seen at the lower edge of each isolated piece of bark, and
therefore (p. 143) the swelling must be attributed &ldquo;to some
other cause than the stoppage of the sap in its return
downwards,&rdquo; because the first gap in the bark should be
sufficient to check the whole of the flowing sap. <a
name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a>&nbsp; He must, in fact have seen that
there is a redistribution of plastic material in each section of
bark.</p>
<p>We now for the moment leave the subject of transpiration and
pass on to that of root-pressure on which Hales is equally
illuminating.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>His first experiment (<i>Vegetable Staticks</i>, p.
100), was with a vine, to which he attached a vertical pipe made
of three lengths of glass-tubing jointed together.&nbsp; His
method is worth notice.&nbsp; He attached the stump to the
manometer with a &ldquo;stiff cement made of melted Beeswax and
Turpentine, and bound it over with several folds of wet bladder
and pack-thread.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot wonder that the making of
water-tight connexions was a great difficulty, and we can
sympathise with his belief that he could have got a column more
than 21 feet high but for the leaking of the joints on several
occasions.&nbsp; He notes the familiar fact that the vine-stump
absorbed water before it began to extrude it.</p>
<p>He afterwards (pp. 106&ndash;7) used a mercury gauge, and
registered a root-pressure of 32&frac12; inches or 36 feet
5&frac12; inches of water, which he proceeds to compare with his
own determination of the blood-pressure of the horse (8 feet) and
of other animals.&nbsp; Perhaps the most interesting of his
root-pressure experiments was that (p. 110) in which several
manometers were attached to the branches of a bleeding vine, and
showed a result which convinced him that &ldquo;the force is not
from the root only, but must proceed from some power in the stem
and branches,&rdquo; a conclusion which some modern workers have
also arrived at.</p>
<h3>Assimilation.</h3>
<p>Hales&rsquo; belief that plants draw part of their food from
the air, and again, that air is the breath of life, of vegetables
as well as of animals (p. 148), are <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>based upon
a series of chemical experiments performed by himself.&nbsp; Not
being satisfied with what he knew of the relation between
&ldquo;air&rdquo; (by which he meant gas) and the solid bodies in
which he supposed gases to be fixed, he delayed the publication
of <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> for some two years, and carried out
the series of observations which are mentioned in his title-page
as &ldquo;An attempt to analyse the air, by a great variety of
chymio-statical experiments,&rdquo; occupying 162 pages of his
book. <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a></p>
<p>The theme of his inquiry he takes (<i>Vegetable Staticks</i>,
p. 165) from &ldquo;the illustrious Sir <i>Isaac
Newton</i>,&rdquo; who believed that &ldquo;dense bodies by
fermentation rarify into several sorts of Air; and this Air by
fermentation, and sometimes without it, returns into dense
bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hales&rsquo; method consisted in heating a variety of
substances, <i>e.g.</i> wheat-grains, pease, wood, hog&rsquo;s
blood, fallow-deer&rsquo;s horn, oyster-shells, red-lead, gold,
etc., and measuring the &ldquo;air&rdquo; given off from
them.&nbsp; He also tried the effect of acid on iron filings,
oyster-shells, etc.&nbsp; In the true spirit of experiment he
began by strongly heating his retorts (one of which was a musket
barrel) to make sure that no air arose from them.&nbsp; It is not
evident to me why he continued at this subject so long.&nbsp; He
had no means of distinguishing one gas from another, and almost
the only quality noted is a want of permanence, <i>e.g.</i> when
the CO2 produced <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>was dissolved by the water over
which he collected it.&nbsp; Sir E. Thorpe <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a> points out that Hales must have
prepared hydrogen, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, sulphur
dioxide, and marsh gas.&nbsp; It may, I think, be said that Hales
deserved the title usually given to Priestley, viz. &ldquo;the
father of pneumatic <a name="citation134b"></a><a
href="#footnote134b" class="citation">[134b]</a>
chemistry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting experiment made by Hales is the
heating of minium (red-lead) with the production of oxygen.&nbsp;
It proves that he knew, as Boyle, Hooke and Mayow did before him,
that a body gains weight in oxidation.&nbsp; Thus Hales remarks:
&ldquo;That the sulphurous and aereal particles of the fire are
lodged in many of those bodies which it acts upon, and thereby
considerably augments their weight, is very evident in Minium or
Red Lead, which is observed to increase in weight in undergoing
the action of the fire.&nbsp; The acquired redness of the Minium
indicating the addition of plenty of sulphur in the
operation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also speaks of the gas distilled from
minium, and remarks: &ldquo;It was doubtless this quantity of air
in the Minium which burst the hermetically sealed glasses of the
excellent <i>Mr. Boyle</i>, when he heated the Minium contained
in them by a burning glass&rdquo; (p. 287).</p>
<p>This was the method also used by Priestley in his celebrated
experiment of heating red-lead in hydrogen, whereby the metallic
lead reappears <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and the hydrogen disappears by
combining with the oxygen set free.&nbsp; This was expressed in
the language of the day as the reconstruction of metallic lead by
the addition of phlogiston (the hydrogen) to the calx of lead
(minium).&nbsp; Thorpe points out the magnitude of the discovery
that Priestley missed, and it may be said that Hales too was on
the track, and had he known as much as Priestley it would not
have been phlogiston that kept him from becoming a Cavendish or
Lavoisier.&nbsp; What chiefly concerns us, however, is the
bearing of Hales&rsquo; chemical work on his theories of
nutrition.&nbsp; He concludes that &ldquo;air makes a very
considerable part of the substance of Vegetables,&rdquo; and goes
on to say (p. 211) that &ldquo;many of these particles of
air&rdquo; are &ldquo;in a fixt state, strongly adhering to and
wrought into the substance of&rdquo; plants. <a
name="citation135a"></a><a href="#footnote135a"
class="citation">[135a]</a>&nbsp; He has some idea of the
instability of complex substances, and of the importance of the
fact, for he says <a name="citation135b"></a><a
href="#footnote135b" class="citation">[135b]</a> that &ldquo;if
all the parts of matter were only endued with a strongly
attracting power, [the] whole [of] nature would then become one
unactive cohering lump.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may remind us of
Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Thus the essential
characteristic of living organic matter, is that it unites this
large quantity of contained motion with a degree of cohesion that
permits temporary fixity of arrangement&rdquo; (<i>First
Principles</i>, &sect; 103).&nbsp; With regard to the way in
which plants absorb and fix the &ldquo;air&rdquo; which he finds
in their <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>tissues, Hales is not clear; he does
not in any way distinguish between respiration and
assimilation.&nbsp; But as I have already said, he definitely
asserts that plants draw &ldquo;sublimed and exalted food&rdquo;
from the air.</p>
<p>As regards the action of light on plants, he suggests (p. 327)
that &ldquo;by freely entering the expanded surfaces of leaves
and flowers&rdquo; light may &ldquo;contribute much to the
ennobling principles of vegetation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on to
quote Newton (<i>Opticks, query</i> 30): &ldquo;The change of
bodies into light, and of light into bodies, is very conformable
to the course of nature, which seems delighted with
transformations.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a problem for the antiquary
to determine, whether or no Swift took from Newton the idea of
bottling and recapturing sunshine as practised by the philosopher
of Lagado.&nbsp; He could hardly have got it from Hales, since
<i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i> was published in 1726, before
<i>Vegetable Staticks</i>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hales is not quite consistent about the action
of light; thus (p. 351) he speaks of the dull light in a closely
planted wood as checking the perspiration of the lower branches,
so that &ldquo;drawing little nourishment, they
perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is doubtless one effect of bad
illumination under the above-named conditions, but the check to
photosynthesis is a more serious result.&nbsp; In his final
remarks on vegetation (p. 375) Hales says in relation to
green-houses, &ldquo;It is certainly of as great importance to
the life of the plants to discharge that infected rancid air by
the admission of fresh, as it is to defend them from the extream
cold of the outward air.&rdquo;&nbsp; This idea of ventilating
greenhouses he carried out in a <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>plant-house
designed by him for the Dowager Princess of Wales, in which warm
fresh air was admitted.&nbsp; The house in question was built in
1761 in the Princess&rsquo;s garden at Kew, which afterwards
became what we now know as Kew Gardens.&nbsp; The site of
Hales&rsquo; greenhouse, which was only pulled down in 1861, is
marked by a big wistaria which formerly grew on the greenhouse
wall.&nbsp; It should be recorded that Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer <a
name="citation137a"></a><a href="#footnote137a"
class="citation">[137a]</a> planned a similar arrangement
independently of Hales, and found it produced a marked
improvement of the well-being of the plants.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note, that though Hales must have known
Malpighi&rsquo;s theory of the function of leaves (which was
broadly speaking the same as his own), he does not as far as I
know refer to it.&nbsp; In his preface (p. ii.) he regrets that
Malpighi and Grew, whose anatomical knowledge he appreciated, had
not &ldquo;fortuned to have fallen into this statical <a
name="citation137b"></a><a href="#footnote137b"
class="citation">[137b]</a> way of inquiry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
believe he means an inquiry of an experimental nature, and I
think it was because Malpighi&rsquo;s theory was dependent on
analogy rather than on ascertained facts that it influenced Hales
so little.</p>
<p>There is another part of physiology on which Hales threw
light.&nbsp; He was the first, I believe, to investigate the
distribution of growth in developing <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>shoots and
growing leaves, by marking them and measuring the distance
between the marks after an interval of time.&nbsp; He describes
(p. 330) and figures (p. 344) with his usual thoroughness the
apparatus employed; this was a comb-like object made by fixing
into a handle five pins &frac14; inch apart from one another; the
points being dipped in red-lead and oil, a young vine-shoot was
marked with ten dots &frac14; inch apart.&nbsp; In the autumn he
examined his specimen, and finds that the youngest internode or
&ldquo;joynt&rdquo; had grown most, and the basal part having
been &ldquo;almost hardened&rdquo; when he marked it, had
&ldquo;extended very little.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this&mdash;a
tentative experiment&mdash;he made the mistake of not
re-measuring his plants at short intervals of time, but it was an
admirable beginning, and the direct ancestor of Sachs&rsquo; <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a> great research on the subject.&nbsp;
In his discussion on growth it is interesting to find the idea of
turgescence supplying the motive force for extension.&nbsp; This
conception he takes from Borelli. <a name="citation138b"></a><a
href="#footnote138b" class="citation">[138b]</a></p>
<p>Hales sees in the nodes of plants &ldquo;plinths or abutments
for the dilating pith to exert its force on&rdquo; (p. 335); but
he acutely foresees a modern objection <a
name="citation138c"></a><a href="#footnote138c"
class="citation">[138c]</a> to the explanation of growth as
regulated solely by the hydrostatic pressure in the cell.&nbsp;
Hales says (p. 335): &ldquo;But a dilating spongy substance, by
equally expanding itself every way, would not <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>produce an
oblong shoot but rather a globose one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not my place to speak of Hales&rsquo; work in animal
physiology, nor of those researches bearing on the welfare of the
human race which occupied his later years.&nbsp; Thus he wrote
against the habit of drinking spirits, and made experiments on
ventilation by which he benefited English and French prisons, and
even the House of Commons; then too he was occupied in attempts
to improve the method of distilling potable water at sea, and of
preserving meat and biscuit on long voyages. <a
name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a></p>
<p>We are concerned with him simply as a vegetable physiologist,
and in that character his fame is imperishable.&nbsp; Of the book
which I have been using as my text, namely, <i>Vegetable
Staticks</i>, Sachs says: &ldquo;It was the first comprehensive
work the world had seen which was devoted to the nutrition of
plants and the movement of their sap. . . .&nbsp; Hales had the
art of making plants reveal themselves.&nbsp; By experiments
carefully planned and cunningly carried out he forced them to
betray the energies hidden in their apparently inactive
bodies.&rdquo; <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a>&nbsp; These words, spoken by a great
physiologist of our day, form a fitting tribute to one who is
justly described as the father of physiology.</p>

<p>There is a well-known story of Charles Darwin which I shall
venture to repeat, because nothing can better emphasise the
contrast between Shrewsbury School as it is and as it was.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin used, as a boy, to work at chemistry in a rough
laboratory fitted up in the tool-house at his home in
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The fact that he did so became known to his
school-fellows, and he was nicknamed &ldquo;Gas.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
have an old Delphine Virgil of my father&rsquo;s in which this
word is scrawled, together with the name Miss Case, no doubt a
sneer at his having come from Case&rsquo;s preparatory
school.&nbsp; Dr. Butler, the Head Master, heard of the chemical
work, and Charles Darwin was once publicly rebuked by that
alarming person for wasting his time on such useless
subjects.&nbsp; My father adds, &ldquo;He called me very unjustly
a <i>poco curante</i>, and as I did not understand what he meant
it seemed to me a fearful reproach.&rdquo;&nbsp; A <i>poco
curante</i> means of course &ldquo;a don&rsquo;t-care
person&rdquo; or one who takes no interest in things, and might
perhaps be translated by &ldquo;slacker.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not
suppose that Dr. Butler is likely ever to be forgotten, but as it
is, he is sure of a reasonable <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>share of
immortality as the author of a description so magnificently
inappropriate. <a name="citation141a"></a><a href="#footnote141a"
class="citation">[141a]</a></p>
<p>This is the contrast I referred to; on one hand a Head Master
in 1822 doing his best to discourage a boy from acquiring
knowledge of a great subject in the best possible way,
<i>i.e.</i> by experiment.&nbsp; And on the other, a Head Master
of the same school in 1911 encouraging, with a wise zeal, the
rational study of science as a regular part of the school
course.&nbsp; It may not be possible to trace out the complete
evolution of these Darwin Buildings, but I like to fancy that the
germ from which they have sprung is that tool house at the Mount.
<a name="citation141b"></a><a href="#footnote141b"
class="citation">[141b]</a></p>
<p>It is some comfort to us to know that Shrewsbury was not the
only place which failed to educate my father in the regulation
lines.&nbsp; When he left school he went to Edinburgh University
to study <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>medicine.&nbsp; But he found anatomy
and <i>materia medica</i> intolerable, and the operating theatre
was a horror.&nbsp; So he began to work at science in his own
way.&nbsp; He learned to stuff birds from an old negro who had
known Waterton.&nbsp; Of this instructor he says, &ldquo;I used
often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant and intelligent
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also caught sea beasts in the pools on the
shore, and made one or two small observations, which were
communicated to the Plinian Society.</p>
<p>Then he was sent to Cambridge with a view to taking
Orders.&nbsp; He enjoyed himself riding and shooting, and
especially in catching beetles in the fens.&nbsp; But also in
more intellectual ways, as in listening to the anthem in
King&rsquo;s Chapel, and looking at the pictures in the
Fitzwilliam Museum.&nbsp; Henslow, the Professor of Botany
treated him as a friend rather than as a pupil, and finally
settled his career by sending him round the world in H.M.S.
<i>Beagle</i>.&nbsp; He entered the ship an undergraduate, and
left it after five years a man of science.&nbsp; I give these
well known details to show how little he profited by any regular
course of study either at Shrewsbury, Edinburgh, or
Cambridge.&nbsp; His start in life depended on the recognition of
his capacity by Henslow, and was nearly wrecked by FitzRoy, the
Captain of the <i>Beagle</i>, suspecting that no one with a nose
like my father&rsquo;s could be an energetic person.</p>
<p>Are we therefore to conclude that the best method of
scientific education is to force a boy to work at uncongenial
subjects?&nbsp; In the case of a genius it may not much matter
what he is taught; <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>he will succeed, in spite of his
education.&nbsp; But for us lesser mortals it does matter.&nbsp;
I am not going to talk about the way in which science should be
taught in schools, a matter about which I am not competent to
speak.&nbsp; What I shall speak of is the learning rather than
teaching of the subject.</p>
<p>I once heard Lord Rayleigh refer to the necessity of putting
one&rsquo;s subject-matter clearly before an audience, and he
illustrated his point by the following story.&nbsp; Somebody,
possibly a lady, came from listening to a lecture by Mr.
So-and-So, and when asked what it was about, replied, &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shall follow Lord
Rayleigh&rsquo;s advice and tell you that my subject is
&ldquo;Why science should be learned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why it is
worth while for a boy to give up some of his time to this
particular form of knowledge, and what advantage he may expect to
gain from so doing.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons for a boy&rsquo;s learning
science.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>I</p>
</td>
<td><p>Because he is told to.&nbsp; This is an excellent reason,
but not inspiriting.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>II</p>
</td>
<td><p>To get marks in an Entrance Scholarship examination.&nbsp;
This is a virtuous reason but not intellectual.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>III</p>
</td>
<td><p>To gain knowledge which will be of use when he comes to
follow a profession, and wants to know physics in view of
becoming an engineer, or physiology as a part of medical
training.&nbsp; This is a worthy reason, but not a common
one.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>IV</p>
</td>
<td><p>Lastly, a boy may learn science because he wants to;
because he finds it entertaining; because it satisfies an
unreasoning desire to know how things in general work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is the best possible reason and the most efficient, and
what I propose, is to inquire whether this wish to know something
of science can be justified.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;science&rsquo; simply means knowledge, but it
is usually applied to knowledge that can be verified.&nbsp; Thus
we learn by heart that Queen Anne died in 1714.&nbsp; I believe
this to be a fact, but I have no means of verifying it.&nbsp; But
if I am told that putting chalk into acid will produce a heavy
gas having the quality of extinguishing a lighted match, I can
verify it.&nbsp; I can do the thing and see the results.&nbsp; I
am now the equal of my teacher; I know it in the same way that he
does.&nbsp; It has become my very own fact, and it seems to have
the satisfactory quality that possession gives.&nbsp; This
characteristic of scientific knowledge is not always
recognised.&nbsp; I mean the profound difference between what we
know and what we are told.&nbsp; When science began to flourish
at Cambridge in the &rsquo;seventies, and the University was
asked to supply money for buildings, an eminent person objected
and said, &ldquo;What do they want with their
laboratories?&mdash;why can&rsquo;t they believe their teachers,
who are in most cases clergymen of the Church of
England?&rdquo;&nbsp; This person had no conception of what the
word &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; means as understood in science.</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Another characteristic of science is that it makes us
able to predict.&nbsp; I have already referred to the fact that
Queen Anne is dead, and we know, or are told, that she died, as I
said before, in 1714; we also know that George I. died in 1727,
and George II. in 1760, but that would not enable us to predict
that George III. would die in 1820.&nbsp; They are isolated facts
not connected by the causal bond that knits together a series of
scientific truths.&nbsp; And this is after all a fortunate thing
for the peace of mind of reigning sovereigns.</p>
<p>It is said that you should never prophesy unless you
know.&nbsp; But science is made up of prophecies.&nbsp; Some are
famous, like the prediction of Adams and Leverrier that a new
planet would be found in a stated position.&nbsp; Some are on a
humbler scale, such as my father&rsquo;s prediction that a big
moth would be found to carry the pollen of Hedychium by brushing
it off with the tips of its hovering wings, a method of
fertilisation unheard of at the time, which however proved to be
the fact.</p>
<p>You may say that it does not matter whether the moth does this
particular thing or not.&nbsp; This is no doubt true from a
strictly commercial point of view.&nbsp; But in science all facts
have some value.&nbsp; We should cultivate a point of view about
facts the very reverse of that of the unknown person who said
that all books are rather dull.</p>
<p>I once heard a celebrated physicist describe how he explained
to an American business man an elaborate spectroscope for
examining the sun.&nbsp; The American asked what good it
was.&nbsp; The physicist explained that with it you can discover
whether or <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>no sodium exists in the sun.&nbsp;
The American was silent for some time, and then said, &ldquo;But
who the &rsquo;nation cares whether there is sodium in the sun or
not?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had not the scientific spirit which does
care about sodium in the sun.</p>
<p>Scientific discovery is, as I said, made up of a series of
prophecies.&nbsp; You observe fact No. 1, and you say if this be
so No. 2 ought to be true, and on examination you find this is
true, and No. 2 suggests No. 3.&nbsp; Or else you find 2 not to
be true; this makes you suspect your original fact, and on
carefully going over your observation you find No. 1 was a
mistaken observation.&nbsp; The successful man of science is one
to whom familiar objects suggest those prophecies generally known
as theories.&nbsp; My father was remarkable for not letting what
seem to be trifling facts pass without suggesting to him a
theory.&nbsp; The flies that are caught on the sundew must have
been seen by innumerable people&mdash;but it remained for him to
prove the truth of his guess that some plants possess digestive
ferments like our own, and live on the insects they catch and
digest.</p>
<p>The art of being guided by slight indications is sometimes
called the method of Zadig, which I learn from Mr. Huxley&rsquo;s
essay and not from Voltaire.&nbsp; Mr. Huxley points out that it
is not only possible thus to prophesy what will happen, but also
to determine what has happened; and he suggests that there should
be a word &lsquo;backtell&rsquo; as well as foretell.&nbsp;
Zadig, who was an oriental philosopher, met one day the
King&rsquo;s servants in great trouble about the loss of their
master&rsquo;s favourite horse.&nbsp; <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>When asked
whether he had seen it he said, &ldquo;A fine galloper, is it
not? small hoofed, five feet high, tail 3&frac12; feet
long.&nbsp; Cheek-pieces of the bit 23-carat gold, shoes
silver.&rdquo;&nbsp; They of course begged to know where it was,
and he said he had not seen it.</p>
<p>This will be recognised as the method of Sherlock Holmes, but
it is also the method of science.&nbsp; Surely you would like to
become scientific under the guidance of that great man.&nbsp; Of
course you are not to be Watsons, but actual detectives, with
Watsons of your own to admire you.&nbsp; And lest you should fear
that the scientific method is alarmingly difficult, I may add
that the method of Zadig or Sherlock Holmes, or of science in
general, is nothing more than glorified common-sense.</p>
<p>It is difficult to talk about a subject which interests one
without seeming to claim that it is superior to all others.&nbsp;
I have not meant to imply this.&nbsp; I have only tried to
explain in what way science differs from some other sort of
knowledge.&nbsp; Nor do I wish to imply that the mind that excels
in science is better or worse than that which one finds in a
great literary man.&nbsp; An eminent oar is worthy of as much
respect as a great cricketer, but he is eminent in a different
way.</p>
<p>I am glad to think that there are points in which science,
literature, and art are equally excellent&mdash;namely, in giving
to mankind some of the deepest pleasures of which he is capable,
in making him realise the wonder, the beauty and the romance of
the world.&nbsp; I spoke of the power of science in knitting
together isolated facts into a <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>theory.&nbsp; And such a theory may become so all
embracing that it is called a law of nature.&nbsp; Those great
generalisations, the laws of gravity and the laws of evolution,
or the laws of chemical combination, have a beauty and dignity
which appeal to everyone.</p>
<p>And on the practical rather than on the theoretical, side
there is wonder, and to my mind beauty, in the bigness and in the
smallness of the spaces that man can deal with.&nbsp; The
astronomer measures out his work, not by miles, but by the
inconceivable distance that light can travel in a year.&nbsp; The
man who studies bacteria measures by the micron, 25,000 of which
go to the inch.&nbsp; To me there is more fascination in the very
small than in the other extreme.&nbsp; It is wonderful to think
that a plant&mdash;a big tree for instance&mdash;is made up of
countless millions of cells, each of which was built by a minute
protoplasmic body, which Huxley has compared to a delicate Ariel
imprisoned like Shakespeare&rsquo;s sprite in an oak-tree.</p>
<p>There is a dramatic effect in even the simplest of
experiments.&nbsp; I, for one, am never weary of the
time-honoured demonstration of a water-plant giving off oxygen as
it assimilates.&nbsp; A twig of Elodea in a large beaker of water
gives off no bubbles in the dull light at the back of the room,
but when close to the window it does so.&nbsp; And with proper
precautions the rate of bubbling becomes an accurate measure of
the intensity of assimilation.&nbsp; To complete the
demonstration the experiment should be repeated with water which
has been boiled, and therefore roughly freed from CO2, when <!--
page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>the rate of bubbling is very greatly diminished.&nbsp;
Finally, by blowing vigorously into the water it may be charged
once more with CO2, and the normal rate of bubbling may be
established.</p>
<p>There are of course innumerable experiments in pure chemistry
and physics which have this romantic quality in the manner in
which they reveal the secrets of the invisible structure of
matter&mdash;but of these I have not much personal
experience.</p>
<p>I think, too, that the human interest of science should always
be encouraged.&nbsp; I mean that those classical experiments, by
which great men have advanced human knowledge, should be shown:
and performed moreover by the original methods, <i>e.g.</i> the
discoveries of Black, Priestley and Cavendish.</p>
<p>After all, the real fun of science begins when one finds out
something that was not known before.&nbsp; This is what is rather
pompously called original research.&nbsp; It is interesting to
see in my father&rsquo;s life how the sporting instinct gave way
to the love of discovery.&nbsp; To show this passionate love of
sport, he mentions that when as a boy he had just shot his first
snipe, his hands trembled so that he could hardly reload his
gun.&nbsp; Yet the same boy on the voyage of the <i>Beagle</i>
found out how much more entrancing than shooting was the chase of
new facts and new theories, and he handed over his gun to his
servant.&nbsp; And something of this delight one may have as the
merest learner.&nbsp; You are not likely to find out things that
nobody knew before, but you may easily find out things quite new
to yourself&mdash;which to you personally are as good as <!--
page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>the brand-newest discovery.&nbsp; Lastly, there is
another excellent reason for scientific work, namely, that the
bodily welfare of the human race and of its friendly animals and
plants depends on accurate knowledge of the nature and behaviour
of everything in the world.&nbsp; It is this truth that makes us
believe that every fact has its value.&nbsp; Its value may remain
unrecognised for long periods, and then it may suddenly find its
place in the great jig-saw puzzle of knowledge.&nbsp; The two
most exciting sciences just now seem to me to be Physics and
Pathology; one as bringing us nearer to the knowledge of the
structure of matter, the other in disentangling the causes of
deadly and mysterious diseases such as malaria, diphtheria,
hydrophobia, sleeping sickness, in a manner and with a success
hitherto undreamt of.&nbsp; But because the advances in these
sciences are so brilliant and hopeful, no civilised worker will
venture to despise the pursuits of less fortunate people whose
work seems rather humdrum.&nbsp; There are botanists who spend
their whole lives in describing and classifying dried plants in a
herbarium.&nbsp; But these are really doing highly valuable work,
for the simple reason that we cannot make any accurate use of
plants until they have names.&nbsp; I am omitting the purely
commercial use of such work, which is very great.&nbsp; I only
want to insist that the mere naming of living things is an
indispensable stone in the building of the palace of
science.&nbsp; All who work at science may recognise that they
belong to a guild which makes for the happiness of the human
race.&nbsp; And this they must do, not with any pride, but humbly
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>acknowledging how small is their personal share in the
total of progress.</p>
<p>The Darwin Buildings, that is to say, the three new
laboratories which are open to-day, were absolutely needed to
carry out the Head Master&rsquo;s plan of giving every boy in the
School a chance of learning science.&nbsp; When I say that at the
present time 270 boys under five masters are at work in the
laboratories, you will realise to what good use they are being
put.&nbsp; As I happen to represent the Royal Society on your
Governing Body it is especially satisfactory to me to know that
science is here taught on the principle expressed by the motto of
the Society: &ldquo;Nullius in verba,&rdquo; that is to say, not
in other people&rsquo;s words, but in your own observation lies
the path of Science.</p>

SIR GEORGE DARWIN <a name="citation152a"></a><a
href="#footnote152a" class="citation">[152a]</a></h2>
<p>George Howard, the fifth <a name="citation152b"></a><a
href="#footnote152b" class="citation">[152b]</a> child of Charles
and Emma Darwin, was born at Down, July 9th, 1845.&nbsp; Why he
was christened <a name="citation152c"></a><a href="#footnote152c"
class="citation">[152c]</a> George, I cannot say.&nbsp; It was
one of the facts on which we founded a theory that our parents
lost their presence of mind at the font, and gave us names for
which there was neither the excuse of tradition nor of preference
on their own part.&nbsp; His second name, however, commemorates
his great-grandmother, Mary Howard, the first wife of Erasmus
Darwin.&nbsp; It seems possible that George&rsquo;s ill-health
and that of his father were inherited from the Howards.&nbsp;
This, at any rate, was Francis Galton&rsquo;s view, who held that
his own excellent health was a heritage from Erasmus
Darwin&rsquo;s second wife.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s second name,
Howard, has a certain appropriateness in his case, for he was the
genealogist and herald of our family, and it is through Mary
Howard that the Darwins can, by an excessively devious route,
claim descent <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>from certain eminent people,
<i>e.g.</i> John of Gaunt.&nbsp; This is shown in the pedigrees
which George wrote out, and in the elaborate genealogical tree
published in Professor&rsquo;s Pearson&rsquo;s <i>Life of Francis
Galton</i>.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s parents had moved to Down in
September 1842, and he was born to those quiet surroundings of
which Charles Darwin wrote, &ldquo;My life goes on like
clockwork, and I am fixed on the spot where I shall end
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would have been difficult to find a more
retired place so near London.&nbsp; In 1842 a coach drive of some
twenty miles was the only means of access to Down; and even now
that railways have crept closer to it, it is singularly out of
the world, with little to suggest the neighbourhood of London,
unless it be the dull haze of smoke that sometimes clouds the
sky.&nbsp; In 1842 such a village, communicating with the main
lines of traffic only by stony tortuous lanes, may well have been
enabled to retain something of its primitive character.&nbsp; Nor
is it hard to believe in the smugglers and their strings of
pack-horses making their way up from the lawless old villages of
the Weald, of which the memory then still lingered. <a
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a></p>
<p>George retained throughout life his deep love for Down.&nbsp;
For the lawn with its bright strip of flowers, and for the row of
big lime trees that bordered it; for the two yew trees between
which we children had our swing, and for many another
characteristic which had become as dear and as familiar to him as
a human face.&nbsp; He retained his youthful love of the
&ldquo;Sand-walk,&rdquo; a little wood far <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>enough from
the house to have for us a romantic character of its own.</p>
<p>George loved the country round Down, and all its dry chalky
valleys of ploughed land, with &ldquo;shaws,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
broad straggling hedges on their crests, bordered by strips of
flowery turf.&nbsp; The country is traversed by many foot-paths;
these George knew well and used skilfully in our walks, in which
he was generally the leader.&nbsp; His love for the house and the
neighbourhood was, I think, entangled with his deepest
feelings.&nbsp; In later years his children came with their
parents to Down, and they vividly remember his excited happiness,
and how he enjoyed showing them his ancient haunts.</p>
<p>In this retired region Charles Darwin&rsquo;s children led a
singularly quiet life, practically without friends, and dependent
on their brothers and sisters for companionship.&nbsp;
George&rsquo;s earliest recollection was of drumming with his
spoon and fork on the nursery table because dinner was late,
while a barrel-organ played outside.&nbsp; Other memories were
less personal; for instance, the firing of guns when Sebastopol
was supposed to have been taken.&nbsp; His diary of 1852 shows a
composite interest in current events and in the picturesqueness
of Natural History: &ldquo;The Duke is dead.&nbsp; Dodos are out
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He perhaps carried rather far the good habit of re-reading
one&rsquo;s favourite authors.&nbsp; He told his children that
for a year or so he read through every day the story of Jack the
Giant Killer, in a little chap-book with coloured pictures.&nbsp;
He early showed <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>signs of the energy which marked his
character in later life.&nbsp; I am glad to remember that I
became his companion and willing slave.&nbsp; There was much
playing at soldiers, and I have a clear remembrance of our
marching with toy guns and knapsacks across the field to the
Sand-walk.&nbsp; There we made our bivouac with gingerbread, and
milk warmed (and generally smoked) over a
&ldquo;touch-wood&rdquo; fire.&nbsp; I was a private while George
was a sergeant, and it was part of my duty to stand sentry at the
far end of the kitchen-garden until released by a bugle-call from
the lawn.&nbsp; I have a vague remembrance of presenting my fixed
bayonet at my father to ward off a kiss, which seemed to me
inconsistent with my military duties.&nbsp; Our imaginary names
and heights were written up on the wall of the cloak-room.&nbsp;
George, with romantic exactitude, made a small foot rule of such
a size that he could conscientiously record his height as 6 feet,
and mine as slightly less, in accordance with my age and
station.</p>
<p>Under my father&rsquo;s instruction George made spears with
weighted heads, which he hurled with remarkable skill by means of
an Australian throwing stick.&nbsp; I used to skulk behind the
big lime trees on the lawn in the character of victim, and I
still remember the look of the spear flying through the air with
a certain venomous waggle.&nbsp; Indoors, too, we threw at each
other wooden javelins, which we received on beautiful shields
made by the village carpenter and decorated with coats of
arms.</p>
<p>Heraldry was a serious pursuit of his for many <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>years, and the London Library copies of Guillim and
Edmonson <a name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> were generally at Down.&nbsp; He
retained a love of the science through life, and his copy of
Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i> is decorated with coats of arms
admirably drawn and painted.&nbsp; In later life he showed a
power of neat and accurate draughtsmanship, and some of the
illustrations in his father&rsquo;s books, <i>e.g.</i> in
<i>Climbing Plants</i>, are by his hand.</p>
<p>His early education was given by governesses, but the boys of
the family used to ride twice or thrice a week to be instructed
in Latin by Mr. Reed, the Rector of Hayes&mdash;the kindest of
teachers.&nbsp; For myself, I chiefly remember the cake we used
to have at 11 o&rsquo;clock, and the occasional diversion of
looking at the pictures in the great Dutch Bible.&nbsp; George
must have impressed his parents with his solidity and
self-reliance, since he was more than once allowed to undertake
alone the 20-mile ride to the house of a relative at Hartfield in
Sussex.&nbsp; For a boy of ten to bait his pony and order his
luncheon at the Edenbridge inn was probably more alarming than
the rest of the adventure.&nbsp; There is indeed a touch of David
Copperfield in his recollections as preserved in family
tradition.&nbsp; The waiter always said, &ldquo;What will you
have for lunch, Sir?&rdquo; to which he replied, &ldquo;What is
there?&rdquo; and the waiter said, &ldquo;Eggs and bacon&rdquo;;
and though he hated bacon more than anything else in the world,
he felt obliged to have it.</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>On August 16th, 1856, George was sent to school.&nbsp;
Our elder brother, William, was at Rugby, and his parents felt
his long absences from home such an evil that they fixed on the
Clapham Grammar School for their younger sons.&nbsp; Besides its
nearness to Down, Clapham had the merit of giving more
mathematics and science than could then be found in public
schools.&nbsp; It was kept by the Rev. Charles Pritchard, <a
name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a> a man of strong character, and with a
gift for teaching mathematics by which George undoubtedly
profited.&nbsp; In, I think, 1861 Pritchard left Clapham and was
succeeded by the Rev. Alfred Wrigley, a man of kindly mood but
without the force or vigour of Pritchard.&nbsp; As a mathematical
instructor I imagine Wrigley was a good drillmaster rather than
an inspiring teacher.&nbsp; Under him the place degenerated to
some extent; it no longer sent so many boys to the Universities,
and became more like a &ldquo;crammer&rsquo;s&rdquo; and less
like a public school.&nbsp; My own recollections of George at
Clapham are coloured by an abiding gratitude for his kindly
protection of me as a shrinking and very unhappy &ldquo;new
boy&rdquo; in 1860.</p>
<p>George records in his diary that in 1863 he tried in vain for
a Minor Scholarship at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and
again failed to get one at Trinity in 1864, though he became a
Foundation Scholar in 1866.&nbsp; These facts suggested to me
that this capacity as a mathematician was the result of slow
growth.&nbsp; I accordingly applied to Lord <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Moulton,
who was kind enough to give me his impressions:</p>
<blockquote><p>My memories of your brother during his
undergraduate career correspond closely to your suggestion that
his mathematical power developed somewhat slowly and late.&nbsp;
Throughout most, if not the whole, of his undergraduate years he
was in the same class as myself and Christie, the ex-Astronomer
Royal, at Routh&rsquo;s. <a name="citation158a"></a><a
href="#footnote158a" class="citation">[158a]</a>&nbsp; We all
recognised him as one who was certain of being high in the
Tripos, but he did not display any of that colossal power of work
and taking infinite trouble that characterised him
afterwards.&nbsp; On the contrary, he treated his work rather
jauntily.&nbsp; At that time his health was excellent and he took
his studies lightly, so that they did not interfere with his
enjoyment of other things. <a name="citation158b"></a><a
href="#footnote158b" class="citation">[158b]</a>&nbsp; I remember
that as the time of the examination came near I used to tell him
that he was unfairly handicapped in being in such robust health
and such excellent spirits.</p>
<p>Even when he had taken his degree I do not think he realised
his innate mathematical power. . . .&nbsp; It has been a standing
wonder to me that he developed the patience for making the
laborious numerical calculations on which so much of his most
original work was necessarily based.&nbsp; He certainly showed no
tendency in that direction during his undergraduate years.&nbsp;
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Indeed, he told me more than once in later life that he
detested arithmetic, and that these calculations were as tedious
and painful to him as they would have been to any other man, but
that he realised that they must be done, and that it was
impossible to train anyone else to do them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Freshman he &lsquo;kept&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> lived) in A
6, the staircase at the N.W. corner of the New Court, afterwards
moving to F 3 in the Old Court, pleasant rooms entered by a
spiral staircase on the south side of the Great Gate.&nbsp; Below
him, in the ground floor room, now used as the College offices,
lived Mr. Colvill, who remained a faithful but rarely seen friend
as long as George lived.</p>
<p>Lord Moulton, who, as we have seen, was a fellow pupil of
George&rsquo;s at Routh&rsquo;s, was held even as a Freshman to
be an assured Senior Wrangler, a prophecy that he easily made
good.&nbsp; The second place was held by George, and was a much
more glorious position than he had dared to hope for.&nbsp; In
those days the examiners read out the list in the Senate House at
an early hour, 8 a.m. I think.&nbsp; George remained in bed and
sent me to bring the news.&nbsp; I remember charging out through
the crowd the moment the magnificent &ldquo;Darwin of
Trinity&rdquo; had followed the expected &ldquo;Moulton of St.
John&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have a general impression of a
cheerful crowd sitting on George&rsquo;s bed and literally almost
smothering him with congratulations.&nbsp; He received the
following characteristic letter from his father: <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span><span
class="smcap">Down</span>, <i>Jan.</i> 24<i>th</i> [1868].</p>
<p>My dear old fellow,</p>
<p>I am so pleased.&nbsp; I congratulate you with all my heart
and soul.&nbsp; I always said from your early days that such
energy, perseverance and talent as yours would be sure to
succeed: but I never expected such brilliant success as
this.&nbsp; Again and again I congratulate you.&nbsp; But you
have made my hand tremble so I can hardly write.&nbsp; The
telegram came here at eleven.&nbsp; We have written to W. and the
boys.</p>
<p>God bless you, my dear old fellow&mdash;may your life so
continue.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your affectionate Father,<br />
<span class="smcap">Ch. Darwin</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In those days the Tripos examination was held in the winter,
and the successful candidates got their degrees early in the Lent
Term.&nbsp; George records in his diary that he took his B.A. on
January 25th, 1868; also that he won the second of the two
Smith&rsquo;s Prizes&mdash;the first being the natural heritage
of the Senior Wrangler.&nbsp; There is little to record in this
year.&nbsp; He had a pleasant time in the summer, coaching
Clement, the nephew of Sir Charles Bunbury, at his beautiful
place Barton Hall in Suffolk.&nbsp; In the autumn he was elected
a Fellow of Trinity, as he records, &ldquo;with Galabin, young
Niven, Clifford, [Sir Frederick] Pollock, and [Sir Sidney]
Colvin.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. K. Clifford was the well-known brilliant
mathematician who died comparatively early.</p>
<p>Chief among his Cambridge friends were the <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>brothers
Arthur, Gerald, and Frank Balfour.&nbsp; The last-named was
killed, aged 31, in a climbing accident in 1882 on the Aiguille
Blanche near Courmayeur.&nbsp; He was remarkable both for his
scientific work and for his striking and most lovable
personality.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s affection for him never
faded.&nbsp; His daughter remembers her father (not long before
his death) saying with emotion, &ldquo;I dreamed Frank Balfour
was alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; I imagine that tennis was the means of
bringing George into contact with Mr. Arthur Balfour.&nbsp; What
began in this chance way grew into an enduring friendship, and
George&rsquo;s diary shows how much kindness and hospitality he
received from Mr. Balfour.&nbsp; George had also the advantage of
knowing Lord Rayleigh at Cambridge, and retained his friendship
through his life.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1869 he was in Paris for two months working
at French.&nbsp; His teacher used to make him write original
compositions, and George gained a reputation for humour by giving
French versions of all the old Joe Millers and ancient stories he
could remember.</p>
<p>It was his intention to make the Bar his profession, <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a> and in October 1869 we find him
reading with Mr. Tatham, in 1870 and 1872 with the late Mr.
Montague Crackenthorpe (then Cookson), and in November 1871 he
was a pupil of Mr. W. G. Harrison.&nbsp; The most valued result
of his legal work was the friendship of Mr. and Mrs.
Crackenthorpe, which he retained throughout his <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>life.&nbsp; During these years we find the first
indications of the circumstances which forced him to give up a
legal career&mdash;namely, his failing health and his growing
inclination towards science. <a name="citation162"></a><a
href="#footnote162" class="citation">[162]</a>&nbsp; Thus in the
summer of 1869, when we were all at Caerdeon in the Barmouth
valley, he writes that he &ldquo;fell ill,&rdquo; and again in
the winter of 1871.&nbsp; His health deteriorated markedly during
1872 and 1873.&nbsp; In the former year he went to Malvern and to
Homburg without deriving any advantage.&nbsp; I have an
impression that he did not expect to survive these attacks, but I
cannot say at what date he made this forecast of an early
death.&nbsp; In January 1873 he visited Cannes, and &ldquo;came
back very ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in the spring of this year
that he first consulted Dr. (afterwards Sir Andrew) Clark, from
whom he received the kindest care.&nbsp; George suffered from
digestive troubles, sickness, and general discomfort and
weakness.&nbsp; Dr. Clark&rsquo;s care probably did what was
possible to make life more bearable, and as time went on his
health gradually improved.&nbsp; In 1894 he consulted the late
Dr. Eccles, and by means of the rest-cure, then something of a
novelty, his weight increased from 9 stone to 9 stone 11
pounds.&nbsp; I gain the impression that this treatment produced
a permanent improvement, although his health remained a serious
handicap throughout his life.</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Meanwhile he had determined on giving up the Bar, and
settled in October 1873, when he was 28 years old, at Trinity in
Nevile&rsquo;s Court next the Library (G 4).&nbsp; His diary
continues to contain records of ill-health and of various
holidays in search of improvement.&nbsp; Thus in 1873 we read,
&ldquo;Very bad during January.&nbsp; Went to Cannes and stayed
till the end of April.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again in 1874,
&ldquo;February to July very ill.&rdquo;&nbsp; In spite of
unwellness he began in 1872&ndash;3 to write on various
subjects.&nbsp; He sent to <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i> <a
name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a> an entertaining article,
&ldquo;Development in Dress,&rdquo; where the survivals in modern
costume were recorded and discussed from the standpoint of
evolution.&nbsp; In 1873 he wrote &ldquo;On beneficial
restriction to liberty of marriage,&rdquo; <a
name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b"
class="citation">[163b]</a> a eugenic article for which he was
attacked with gross unfairness and bitterness by the late St.
George Mivart.&nbsp; He was defended by Huxley; and Charles
Darwin formally ceased all intercourse with Mivart.&nbsp; We find
mention of a &ldquo;Globe Paper for the British
Association&rdquo; in 1873.&nbsp; And in the following year he
read a contribution on &ldquo;Probable Error&rdquo; to the
Mathematical Society <a name="citation163c"></a><a
href="#footnote163c" class="citation">[163c]</a>&mdash;on which
he writes in his diary, &ldquo;found it was old.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Besides another paper in the <i>Messenger of Mathematics</i>, he
reviewed &ldquo;Whitney on Language,&rdquo; <a
name="citation163d"></a><a href="#footnote163d"
class="citation">[163d]</a> and wrote a &ldquo;Defence of
Jevons&rdquo; which I have not been able to trace.&nbsp; In 1875
he was at work on the <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>&ldquo;Flow of Pitch,&rdquo; on an
&ldquo;Equipotential Tracer,&rdquo; on slide rules, and sent a
paper on &ldquo;Cousin Marriages&rdquo; to the Statistical
Society. <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a>&nbsp; It is not my province to deal
with these papers; they are enumerated here as showing his
activity of mind and his varied interests,&mdash;features in his
character which were notable throughout life.</p>
<p>The most interesting entry in his diary for 1875 is a
&ldquo;Paper on Equipotentials much approved by Sir W.
Thomson.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the first notice of an association
of primary importance in George&rsquo;s scientific career.&nbsp;
Then came his memoir, &ldquo;On the influence of geological
changes in the earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord
Kelvin was one of the referees appointed by the Council of the
Royal Society to report on this paper, which was published in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> in 1877.</p>
<p>In his diary, November 1878, George records, &ldquo;Paper on
tides ordered to be printed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This refers to his
work, &ldquo;On the bodily tides of viscous and semi-elastic
spheroids, etc.,&rdquo; published in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> in
1879.&nbsp; It was in regard to this paper that his father wrote
to George on October 29th, 1878: <a name="citation164b"></a><a
href="#footnote164b" class="citation">[164b]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My dear old George,</p>
<p>I have been quite delighted with your letter and read it all
with eagerness.&nbsp; You were very good to write it.&nbsp; All
of us are delighted, for considering what a man Sir <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>William Thomson is, it is most grand that you should
have staggered him so quickly, and that he should speak of your
&lsquo;discovery, etc.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; Hurrah for the bowels
of the earth and their viscosity, and for the moon and for the
Heavenly bodies, and for my son George (F.R.S. very soon). . . .
<a name="citation165a"></a><a href="#footnote165a"
class="citation">[165a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bond of pupil and master between George Darwin and Lord
Kelvin, originating in the years 1877&ndash;8, was to be a
permanent one, and developed, not merely into scientific
co-operation, but into a close friendship.&nbsp; Sir Joseph
Larmor has recorded <a name="citation165b"></a><a
href="#footnote165b" class="citation">[165b]</a> that
George&rsquo;s &ldquo;tribute to Lord Kelvin, to whom he
dedicated Volume I of his Collected Papers <a
name="citation165c"></a><a href="#footnote165c"
class="citation">[165c]</a> . . . gave lively pleasure to his
master and colleague.&rdquo;&nbsp; His words were:</p>
<blockquote><p>Early in my scientific career it was my good
fortune to be brought into close personal relationship with Lord
Kelvin.&nbsp; Many visits to Glasgow and to Largs have brought me
to look up to him as my master, and I cannot find words to
express how much I owe to his friendship and to his
inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During these years there is evidence that he continued to
enjoy the friendship of Lord Rayleigh and of Mr. Balfour.&nbsp;
We find in his diary records <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>of visits
to Terling and to Whittingehame, or of luncheons at Mr.
Balfour&rsquo;s house in Carlton Gardens, for which
George&rsquo;s scientific committee work in London gave frequent
opportunity.&nbsp; In the same way there are many records of
visits to Francis Galton, with whom he was united alike by
kinship and affection.</p>
<p>Few people indeed can have taken more pains to cultivate
friendship than did George.&nbsp; This trait was the product of
his affectionate and eminently sociable nature, and of his
characteristic energy and activity.&nbsp; In earlier life he
travelled a good deal in search of health, <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> and in after years he attended
numerous congresses as a representative of scientific
bodies.&nbsp; He thus had unusual opportunities of making the
acquaintance of men of other nationalities, and some of his
warmest friendships were with foreigners.&nbsp; In passing
through Paris he rarely failed to visit M. and Mme
d&rsquo;Estournelles and &ldquo;the
d&rsquo;Abbadies.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in Algiers in 1878 and 1879
that he cemented his friendship with the late J. F. MacLennan,
author of <i>Primitive Marriage</i>; and in 1880 he was at Davos
with the same friends.&nbsp; In 1881 he went to Madeira, where he
received much kindness from the Blandy family&mdash;doubtless
through the recommendation of Lady Kelvin.</p>
<h3>Cambridge.</h3>
<p>We have seen that George was elected a Fellow of Trinity in
October 1868, and that five years <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>later
(October 1873) he began his second lease of a Cambridge
existence.&nbsp; There is at first little to record: he held at
this time no official position, and when his Fellowship expired
he continued to live in College, busy with his research work, and
laying down the earlier tiers of the monumental series of papers
which he gave to the world.&nbsp; This soon led to his being
proposed (in November 1877) for the Royal Society, and elected in
June 1879.&nbsp; The principal event in this stage of his
Cambridge life was his election in 1883 as Plumian Professor of
Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. <a
name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a>&nbsp; His predecessor in the Chair was
Professor Challis, who had held office since 1836, and is now
chiefly remembered in connection with Adams and the planet
Neptune.&nbsp; The professorship is not necessarily connected
with the Observatory, and practical astronomy formed no part of
George&rsquo;s duties.&nbsp; His lectures being on advanced
mathematics usually attracted but few students; in the Long
Vacation, however, when he habitually gave one of his courses,
there was often a fairly large class.&nbsp; <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>George&rsquo;s relations with his class have been
sympathetically treated by Professor E. W. Brown, <a
name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a> than whom no one can speak with more
authority, since he was one of my brother&rsquo;s favourite
pupils.</p>
<p>In the late &rsquo;70&rsquo;s George began to be appointed to
various University Boards and Syndicates.&nbsp; Thus from
1878&ndash;82 he was on the Museums and Lecture Rooms
Syndicate.&nbsp; In 1879 he was placed on the Observatory
Syndicate, of which he became an official member in 1883 on his
election to the Plumian Professorship.&nbsp; In the same way he
was on the Special Board for Mathematics.&nbsp; He was a member
of the Financial Board from 1900&ndash;1 to 1903&ndash;4, and on
the Council of the Senate in 1905&ndash;6 and 1908&ndash;9.&nbsp;
But he never became a professional syndic&mdash;one of those
virtuous persons who spend their lives in University
affairs.&nbsp; In his obituary of George (<i>Nature</i>, December
12, 1912), Sir Joseph Larmor writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the affairs of the University, of which he was
an ornament, Sir George Darwin made a substantial mark, though it
cannot be said that he possessed the patience in discussion that
is sometimes a necessary condition to taking a share in its
administration.&nbsp; But his wide acquaintance and friendships
among the statesmen and men of affairs of the time, dating often
from undergraduate days, gave him openings for usefulness on a
wider plane.&nbsp; Thus, at a time when residents were bewailing
even more than usual the inadequacy of the <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>resources
of the University for the great expansion which the scientific
progress of the age demanded, it was largely on his initiative
that, by a departure from all precedent, an unofficial body was
constituted in 1899 under the name of the Cambridge University
Association, to promote the further endowment of the University
by interesting its graduates throughout the Empire in its
progress and its more pressing needs.&nbsp; This important body,
which was organised under the strong lead of the late Duke of
Devonshire, then Chancellor, comprises as active members most of
the public men who owe allegiance to Cambridge, and has already
by its interest and help powerfully stimulated the expansion of
the University into new fields of national work, though it has
not yet achieved financial support on anything like the scale to
which American seats of learning are accustomed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Master of Christ&rsquo;s writes:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>May</i> 31<i>st</i>,
1915.</p>
<p>My impression is that George did not take very much interest
in the petty details which are so beloved by a certain type of
University authority.&nbsp; &lsquo;Comma hunting&rsquo; and such
things were not to his taste, and at meetings he was often rather
distrait, but when anything of real importance came up he was of
extraordinary use.&nbsp; He was especially good at drafting
letters, and over anything that he thought promoted the
advancement of the University along the right lines he would take
endless trouble&mdash;writing and re-writing reports and letters
till he got them to his taste.&nbsp; The <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>sort of
movements which interested him most were those which connected
Cambridge with the outside world.&nbsp; He was especially
interested in the Appointments Board.&nbsp; A good many of us
constantly sought his advice, and nearly always took it: but, as
I say, I do not think he cared much about the &lsquo;parish
pump,&rsquo; and was usually worried at long meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Newall has also been good enough to give me his
impressions:</p>
<blockquote><p>His weight in the committees on which I have had
personal experience of his influence seems to me to have depended
in large measure on his realising very clearly the distinction
between the importance of ends to be aimed at and the difficulty
of harmonising the personal characteristics of the men who might
be involved in the work needed to attain the ends.&nbsp; The ends
he always took seriously&mdash;the crotchets he often took
humorously, to the great easement of many situations that are
liable to arise on a committee.&nbsp; I can imagine that to those
who had corns his direct progress may at times have seemed
unsympathetic and hasty.&nbsp; He was ready to take much trouble
in formulating statements of business with great
precision&mdash;a result doubtless of his early legal
experiences.&nbsp; I recall how he would say, &ldquo;If a thing
has to be done, the minute should if possible make some
individual responsible for doing it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would ask,
&ldquo;Who is going to do the work?&nbsp; If a man has to take
the responsibility, we must do what we can to help him, and not
hamper him by unnecessary restrictions and
criticisms.&rdquo;&nbsp; His helpfulness <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>came from
his quickness in seizing the important point and his readiness to
take endless trouble in the important work of looking into
details before and after the meetings.&nbsp; The amount of work
that he did in response to the requirements of various Committees
was very great, and it was curious to realise in how many cases
he seemed to have diffidence as to the value of his
contributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on the whole, the work which he was able to carry out, in
addition to professional duties and research, was in matters of
general importance unconnected with the University.&nbsp; To
these we shall return.</p>
<p>In 1884 he became engaged to Miss Maud Du Puy of
Philadelphia.&nbsp; She came of an old Huguenot stock, descending
from Dr. John Du Puy, who was born in France in 1679, and settled
in New York in 1713.&nbsp; They were married on July 22nd, 1884,
and this event happily coloured the remainder of George&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; As time went on, and existence became fuller and
busier, she was able by her never-failing devotion to shield him
from fatigue and anxiety.&nbsp; In this way he was helped and
protected in the various semi-public functions in which he took a
principal part.&nbsp; Nor was her help valued only on these
occasions, for indeed the comfort and happiness of every day was
in her charge.&nbsp; There is a charming letter <a
name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a> from George&rsquo;s mother, dated
April 15th, 1884:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maud had to put on her wedding-dress in order to
say at the Custom-house in America <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>that she
had worn it, so we asked her to come down and show it to
us.&nbsp; She came down with great simplicity and quietness . . .
only really pleased at its being admired and at looking pretty
herself, which was strikingly the case.&nbsp; She was a little
shy at coming in, and sent in Mrs. Jebb to ask George to come out
and see it first and bring her in.&nbsp; It was handsome and
simple.&nbsp; I like seeing George so frivolous, so deeply
interested in which diamond trinket should be my present, and in
her new Paris morning dress, in which he felt quite unfit to walk
with her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, probably in June, George&rsquo;s mother wrote <a
name="citation172a"></a><a href="#footnote172a"
class="citation">[172a]</a> to Miss Du Puy, &ldquo;Your visit
here was a great happiness to me, as something in you (I
don&rsquo;t know what) made me feel sure you would always be
sweet and kind to George when he is ill and
uncomfortable.&rdquo;&nbsp; These simple and touching words may
be taken as a true forecast of his happy married life.</p>
<p>In March 1885 George acquired by purchase the house Newnham
Grange, <a name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a> which remained his home to the end of
his life.&nbsp; It stands at the southern end of the
&lsquo;Backs,&rsquo; within a few yards of the river where it
bends eastward in flowing from the upper to the lower of the two
Newnham water-mills.&nbsp; I remember forebodings as to dampness,
<!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>but they proved wrong&mdash;even the cellars being
remarkably dry.&nbsp; The house is built of faded yellowish
bricks, with old tiles on the roof, and has a pleasant home-like
air.&nbsp; It was formerly the house of the Beales family, <a
name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a> one of the old merchant stocks of
Cambridge.&nbsp; This fact accounts for the great barn-like
granaries which occupied much of the plot near the high
road.&nbsp; These buildings were in part pulled down, thus making
room for a lawn tennis court, while what was not demolished made
a gallery looking on the court, as well as play-room for the
children.&nbsp; At the eastern end of the property a cottage and
part of the granaries were converted into a small house of an
attractively individual character, for which I think tenants have
hitherto been easily found among personal friends.&nbsp; One of
the most pleasant features of the Grange was the flower-garden
and rockery on the other side of the river, reached by a wooden
bridge and called &ldquo;the Little Island.&rdquo; <a
name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a>&nbsp; The house is conveniently close
to the town, yet has a most pleasant outlook, <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to the
north over the Backs while there is the river and the Fen to the
south.&nbsp; The children had a den or house in the branches of a
large copper beech tree overhanging the river.&nbsp; They were
allowed to use the boat, which was known as the <i>Griffin</i>,
from the family crest with which it was adorned.&nbsp; None of
them were drowned, though accidents were not unknown; in one of
these an eminent lady and well-known writer, who was inveigled on
to the river by the children, had to wade to shore near Silver
Street bridge owing to the boat running aground.</p>
<p>The Darwins had five children, of whom one died an infant: of
the others, Charles Galton Darwin has inherited much of his
father&rsquo;s mathematical ability, and has been elected to a
Mathematical Lectureship at Christ&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; He is
now in the Army, and employed in research work in France.&nbsp;
The younger son, William, has a commission in the 18th Battalion
of the Durham Light Infantry, and is now working with his
brother.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s elder daughter is married to
Monsieur Jacques Raverat.&nbsp; Her skill as an artist has
perhaps its hereditary root in her father&rsquo;s
draughtsmanship.&nbsp; The younger daughter, Margaret, is married
to Mr. Geoffrey Keynes.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s relations with his family were most
happy.&nbsp; His diary never fails to record the dates on which
the children came home, or the black days which took them to
school.&nbsp; There are constantly recurring entries in his diary
of visits to the boys at Marlborough or Winchester, or of the
journeys to arrange for the schooling of the girls in England
<!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>or abroad.&nbsp; The parents took pains that their
children should have opportunities of learning conversational
French and German.</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s characteristic energy showed itself not only in
these ways but also in devising bicycling expeditions and
informal picnics for the whole family, to the Fleam Dyke, to
Whittlesford, or other pleasant spots near home; and these
excursions he enjoyed as much as anyone of the party.&nbsp; As he
always wished to have his children with him, one or more
generally accompanied him and his wife when they attended
congresses or other scientific gatherings abroad.</p>
<p>His house was the scene of many Christmas dinners, the first
of which I find any record being in 1886.&nbsp; These meetings
were often made an occasion for plays acted by the children; of
these the most celebrated was a Cambridge version of <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, in which the hero and heroine were scions of the
rival factions of Trinity and St. John&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3>Games and Pastimes.</h3>
<p>As an undergraduate George played tennis&mdash;not the modern
out-door game, but that regal pursuit which is sometimes known as
the game of kings and otherwise as the king of games.&nbsp; When
George came up as an undergraduate there were two tennis courts
in Cambridge, one in the East Road, the other being the ancient
one that gave its name to Tennis Court Road, and was pulled down
to make room for the new buildings of <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Pembroke.&nbsp; In this way was destroyed the last of
the College tennis courts of which we read in Mr. Clark&rsquo;s
<i>History</i>.&nbsp; I think George must have had pleasure in
the obvious development of the tennis court from some
prim&aelig;val farm-yard in which the <i>pent-house</i> was the
roof of a shed, and the <i>grille</i> a real window or
half-door.&nbsp; To one brought up on evolution there is also a
satisfaction about the French terminology which survives in
<i>e.g.</i> the <i>Tambour</i> and the <i>Dedans</i>.&nbsp;
George put much thought into acquiring a correct style of play;
for in tennis there is a religion of attitude corresponding to
that which painfully regulates the life of the golfer.&nbsp; He
became a good tennis player as an undergraduate, and was in the
running for a place in the inter-University match.&nbsp; The
marker at the Pembroke court was Henry Harradine, whom we all
sincerely liked and respected, but he was not a good teacher, and
it was only when George came under Henry&rsquo;s sons, John and
Jim Harradine, at the Trinity and Clare court, that his game
began to improve.&nbsp; He continued to play tennis for some
years, and only gave it up after a blow from a tennis ball in
January 1895 had almost destroyed the sight of his left eye.</p>
<p>In 1910 he took up archery, and zealously set himself to
acquire the correct mode of standing, the position of the head
and hands, etc.&nbsp; He kept an archery diary in which each
day&rsquo;s shooting is carefully analysed and the results given
in percentages.&nbsp; In 1911 he shot on 131 days: the last
occasion on which he took out his bow was September 13, 1912.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>I am indebted to Mr. H. Sherlock, who often shot with
him at Cambridge, for his impressions.&nbsp; He writes: &ldquo;I
shot a good deal with your brother the year before his death; he
was very keen on the sport, methodical and painstaking, and paid
great attention to style, and as he had a good natural
&lsquo;loose,&rsquo; which is very difficult to acquire, there is
little doubt (notwithstanding that he came to archery rather late
in life) that had he lived he would have been above the average
of the men who shoot fairly regularly at the public
meetings.&rdquo;&nbsp; After my brother&rsquo;s death Mr.
Sherlock was good enough to look at George&rsquo;s archery
note-book.&nbsp; &ldquo;I then saw,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that
he had analysed them in a way which, so far as I am aware, had
never been done before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Sherlock has given
examples of the method in a sympathetic obituary published (p.
273)in <i>The Archer&rsquo;s Register</i>. <a
name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a>&nbsp; George&rsquo;s point was that
the traditional method of scoring is not fair in regard to the
areas of the coloured rings of the target.&nbsp; Mr. Sherlock
records in his <i>Notice</i> that George joined the Royal
Toxophilite Society in 1912, and occasionally shot in the
Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; In 1912 he won the Norton Cup and
Medal (144 arrows at 120 yards.)</p>
<p>There was a billiard table at Down, and George learned to play
fairly well, though he had no pretension to real
proficiency.&nbsp; He used to play at the Athenaeum, and in 1911
we find him playing there in the Billiard Handicap, but a week
later he records in his diary that he was &ldquo;knocked
out.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Scientific Committees.</h3>
<p>George served for many years on the Solar Physics Committee
and on the Meteorological Council.&nbsp; With regard to the
latter, Sir Napier Shaw has at my request given me his
impressions: <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It was in February 1885, upon the retirement of
Warren De la Rue, that your brother George, by appointment of the
Royal Society, joined the governing body of the Meteorological
Office, at that time the Meteorological Council.&nbsp; He
remained a member until the end of the Council in 1905, and
thereafter, until his death, he was one of the two nominees of
the Royal Society upon the Meteorological Committee, the new body
which was appointed by the Treasury to take over the control of
the administration of the Office. . . .</p>
<p>The Commissioners, collectively known as the Meteorological
Council, were a remarkably distinguished body of Fellows of the
Royal Society, and when Darwin took the place of De la Rue, the
members were men subsequently famous, as Sir Richard Strachey,
Sir William Wharton, Sir George Stokes, Sir Francis Galton, Sir
George Darwin, with E. J. Stone, a former Astronomer Royal for
the Cape. . . .</p>
<p>I do not think that Darwin addressed himself spontaneously to
meteorological problems, but he was always ready to help.&nbsp;
He was very regular in his attendance at Council, and the minutes
show that after Stokes retired, all questions involving physical
measurement or <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>mathematical reasoning were referred
to him.&nbsp; There is a short and very characteristic report
from him on the work of the harmonic analyser, and a considerable
number upon researches by Mr. Dines or Sir G. Stokes on
anemometers.&nbsp; It is hardly possible to exaggerate his
aptitude for work of that kind.&nbsp; He could take a real
interest in things that were not his own.&nbsp; He was full of
sympathy and appreciation for efforts of all kinds, especially
those of young men, and at the same time, using his wide
experience, he was perfectly frank and fearless not only in his
judgment but also in the expression of it.&nbsp; He gave one the
impression of just protecting himself from boredom by habitual
loyalty and a finely tempered sense of duty.&nbsp; My earliest
recollection of him on the Council is the thrilling production of
a new version of the Annual Report of the Council which he had
written because the original had become more completely
&lsquo;scissors and paste&rsquo; than he could endure.</p>
<p>After the Office came into my charge in 1900, so long as he
lived I never thought of taking any serious step without first
consulting him, and he was always willing to help by his advice,
by his personal influence and by his special knowledge.&nbsp; For
the first six years of the time I held a college fellowship, with
the peculiar condition of four public lectures in the University
each year and no emolument.&nbsp; One year, when I was rather
overdone, Darwin took the course for me, and devoted the lectures
to Dynamical Meteorology.&nbsp; I believe he got it up for the
occasion, for he professed the utmost diffidence about it, but
the progress <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>which we have made in recent years
in that subject dates from those lectures and the correspondence
which arose upon them.</p>
<p>In Council it was the established practice to proceed by
agreement and not by voting; he had a wonderful way of bringing a
discussion to a head by courageously &lsquo;voicing&rsquo; the
conclusion to which it led, and frankly expressing the general
opinion without hurting anybody&rsquo;s feelings. . . .</p>
<p>It is not easy to give expression to the powerful influence
which he exercised upon all departments of official meteorology
without making formal contributions to meteorological
literature.&nbsp; He gave me a note on a curious point in the
evaluation of the velocity equivalents of the Beaufort Scale,
which is published in the Office Memoirs No. 180, and that is all
I have to show in print, but he was in and behind everything that
was done, and personally, I need hardly add, I owe to him much
more than this or any other letter can fully express.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 6, 1904, the year of the South African meeting, he was
elected President of the British Association.</p>
<p>On July 29, 1905, he embarked with his wife and his son
Charles, and arrived on August 15 at the Cape, where he gave the
first part of his Presidential Address.&nbsp; Here he had the
pleasure of finding as Governor, Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, whom
he had known as a Trinity undergraduate.&nbsp; He was the guest
of the late Sir David Gill, who remained a close friend for the
rest of his life.&nbsp; George&rsquo;s diary gives his
itinerary&mdash;which shows the <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>trying
amount of travel that he went through.&nbsp; A sample may be
quoted:</p>

<p>At Johannesburg he gave the second half of his Address.&nbsp;
Then on by Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Bulawayo, to the Victoria
Falls, where a bridge had to be opened.&nbsp; Then to Portuguese
Africa on September 16, 17, where he made speeches in French and
English.&nbsp; Finally he arrived at Suez on October 4, and got
home October 18.</p>
<p>It was generally agreed that his Presidentship was a
conspicuous success.&nbsp; The following appreciation is from the
obituary notice in <i>The Observatory</i>, January 1913, p.
58:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Association visited a dozen towns, and at each
halt its President addressed an audience partly new, and partly
composed of people who had been travelling with him for many
weeks.&nbsp; At each place this latter section heard with
admiration a treatment of his subject wholly fresh and exactly
adapted to the locality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such duties are always trying, and it should not be forgotten
that tact was necessary in a country which only two years before
was still in the throes of war.</p>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>In the autumn he received the honour of being made a
K.C.B.&nbsp; The distinction was doubly valued as being announced
to him by his friend Mr. Balfour, then Prime Minister.</p>
<p>From 1899 to 1900 he was President of the Royal Astronomical
Society.&nbsp; One of his last Presidential acts was the
presentation of the Society&rsquo;s Medal to his friend M.
Poincar&eacute;.</p>
<p>He had the unusual distinction of serving twice as President
of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, once in 1890&ndash;92 and
again 1911&ndash;12.</p>
<p>In 1891 he gave the Bakerian Lecture <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a> of the Royal Society, his subject
being &ldquo;Tidal Prediction.&rdquo;&nbsp; This annual
pr&aelig;lection dates from 1775, and the list of lecturers is a
distinguished roll of names.</p>
<p>In 1897 he lectured at the Lowell Institute at Boston, and
this was the origin of his book on <i>Tides</i>, published in the
following year.&nbsp; Of this Sir Joseph Larmor says <a
name="citation182b"></a><a href="#footnote182b"
class="citation">[182b]</a> that &ldquo;it has taken rank with
the semi-popular writings of Helmholtz and Kelvin as a model of
what is possible in the exposition of a scientific
subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has passed through three English
editions, and has been translated into many foreign
languages.</p>
<h3>International Associations.</h3>
<p>During the last ten or fifteen years of his life George was
much occupied with various International bodies, <i>e.g.</i> the
International Geodetic <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>Association, the International Association of
Academies, the International Congress of Mathematicians, and the
Seismological Congress.</p>
<p>With regard to the last named it was in consequence of
George&rsquo;s report to the Royal Society that the British
Government joined the Congress.&nbsp; It was however with the
Geodetic Association that he was principally connected.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Larmor (<i>Nature</i>, December 12, 1912) gives the
following account of the origin of the Association:</p>
<blockquote><p>The earliest of topographic surveys, the model
which other national surveys adopted and improved upon, was the
Ordnance Survey of the United Kingdom.&nbsp; But the great
trigonometrical survey of India, started nearly a century ago,
and steadily carried on since that time by officers of the Royal
Engineers, is still the most important contribution to the
science of the figure of the earth, though the vast geodetic
operations in the United States are now following it
closely.&nbsp; The gravitational and other complexities incident
on surveying among the great mountain masses of the Himalayas
early demanded the highest mathematical assistance.&nbsp; The
problems originally attacked in India by Archdeacon Pratt were
afterwards virtually taken over by the Royal Society, and its
secretary, Sir George Stokes, of Cambridge, became from 1864
onwards the adviser and referee of the survey as regards its
scientific enterprises.&nbsp; On the retirement of Sir George
Stokes this position fell very largely to Sir George Darwin,
whose relations with the India Office on this and other affairs
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>remained close, and very highly appreciated, throughout
the rest of his life.</p>
<p>The results of the Indian survey have been of the highest
importance for the general science of geodesy. . . .&nbsp; It
came to be felt that closer co-operation between different
countries was essential to practical progress and to coordination
of the work of overlapping surveys.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the further history of George&rsquo;s connection with the
Association, I am indebted to the Secretary, Dr. van d. Sande
Bakhuyzen.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the proposal of the Royal Society the British
Government, after having consulted the Director of the Ordnance
Survey, in 1898, resolved upon the adhesion of Great Britain to
the International Geodetic Association, and appointed as its
delegate, G. H. Darwin.&nbsp; By his former researches and by his
high scientific character, he, more than any other, was entitled
to this position, which would afford him an excellent opportunity
of furthering, by his recommendations, the study of theoretical
geodesy. . .</p>
<p>We cannot relate in detail his valuable co-operation as a
member of the Council in the various transactions of the
Association, for instance, on the junction of the Russian and
Indian triangulations through Pamir, but we must gratefully
remember his great service to the Association when, at his
invitation, the delegates met in 1909 for the 16th General
Conference in London and Cambridge.</p>
<p>With the utmost care he prepared everything to render the
Conference as interesting and agreeable as possible, and he fully
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>succeeded.&nbsp; Through his courtesy the foreign
delegates had the opportunity of making the personal acquaintance
of several members of the Geodetic staff of England and its
colonies, and of other scientific men, who were invited to take
part in the Conference; and when after four meetings in London
the delegates went to Cambridge to continue their work, they
enjoyed the most cordial hospitality from Sir George and Lady
Darwin, who, with her husband, procured them in Newnham Grange
happy leisure hours between their scientific labours.</p>
<p>At this conference Darwin delivered various reports, and at
the discussion on Hecker&rsquo;s determination of the variation
of the vertical by the attraction of the moon and sun, he gave an
interesting account of the researches on the same subject made by
him and his brother Horace more than 20 years ago, which
unfortunately failed from the bad conditions of the places of
observation.</p>
<p>In 1912 Sir George, though already over-fatigued by the
preparations for the Mathematical Congress in Cambridge, and the
exertions entailed by it, nevertheless prepared the different
reports on the geodetic work in the British Empire, but, alas,
his illness prevented him from assisting at the conference at
Hamburg, where they were presented by other British
delegates.&nbsp; The conference thanked him, and sent him its
best wishes, but at the end of the year the Association had to
deplore the loss of the man who in theoretical geodesy as well as
in other branches of mathematics and astronomy stood in the first
rank, and who <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>for his noble character was
respected and beloved by all his colleagues in the International
Geodetic Association.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Joseph Larmor writes: <a name="citation186"></a><a
href="#footnote186" class="citation">[186]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sir George Darwin&rsquo;s last public appearance
was as president of the fifth International Congress of
Mathematicians, which met at Cambridge on August 22&ndash;28,
1912.&nbsp; The time for England to receive the congress having
obviously arrived, a movement was initiated at Cambridge, with
the concurrence of Oxford mathematicians, to send an invitation
to the fourth congress held at Rome in 1908.&nbsp; The proposal
was cordially accepted, and Sir George Darwin, as <i>doyen</i> of
the mathematical school at Cambridge, became chairman of the
organising committee, and was subsequently elected by the
congress to be their president.&nbsp; Though obviously unwell
during part of the meeting, he managed to discharge the delicate
duties of the chair with conspicuous success, and guided with
great verve the deliberations of the final assembly of what
turned out to be a most successful meeting of that important
body.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Personal Characteristics.</h3>
<p>His daughter, Madame Raverat, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think most people might not realise that the
sense of adventure and romance was the most important thing in my
father&rsquo;s life, except his love of work.&nbsp; He thought
about all life romantically, and his own life in particular; <!--
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>one could feel it in the quality of everything he said
about himself.&nbsp; Everything in the world was interesting and
wonderful to him, and he had the power of making other people
feel it.</p>
<p>He had a passion for going everywhere and seeing everything;
learning every language, knowing the technicalities of every
trade; and all this emphatically <i>not</i> from the scientific
or collector&rsquo;s point of view, but from a deep sense of the
romance and interest of everything.&nbsp; It was splendid to
travel with him; he always learned as much as possible of the
language, and talked to everyone; we had to see simply everything
there was to be seen, and it was all interesting, like an
adventure.&nbsp; For instance, at Vienna I remember being taken
to a most improper music hall, and at Sch&ouml;nbrunn hearing
from an old forester the whole secret history of the old
Emperor&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; My father would tell us the stories of
the places we went to with an incomparable conviction and sense
of the reality and dramaticness of the events.&nbsp; It is
absurd, of course, but in that respect he always seemed to me a
little like Sir Walter Scott. <a name="citation187"></a><a
href="#footnote187" class="citation">[187]</a></p>
<p>The books he used to read to us when we were quite small, and
which we adored, were Percy&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i> and the
<i>Prologue to the </i><!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span><i>Canterbury Tales</i>.&nbsp; He used often to read
Shakespeare to himself, I think generally the historical plays;
also Chaucer, <i>Don Quixote</i> in Spanish, and all kind of
books like Joinville&rsquo;s <i>Life of St. Louis</i> in the old
French.</p>
<p>I remember the story of the death of Gordon told so that we
all cried, I think; and Gladstone could hardly be mentioned in
consequence.&nbsp; All kinds of wars and battles interested him,
and I think he liked archery more because it was romantic than
because it was a game.</p>
<p>During his last illness his interest in the Balkan war never
failed.&nbsp; Three weeks before his death he was so ill that the
doctor thought him dying.&nbsp; Suddenly he rallied from the
half-unconscious state in which he had been lying for many hours,
and the first words he spoke on opening his eyes were,
&ldquo;Have they got to Constantinople yet?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
very characteristic.&nbsp; I often wish he was alive now, because
his understanding and appreciation of the glory and tragedy of
this war would be like no one else&rsquo;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His daughter Margaret writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was absolutely unselfconscious, and it never
seemed to occur to him to wonder what impression he was making on
others.&nbsp; I think it was this simplicity which made him so
good with children.&nbsp; He seemed to understand their point of
view, and to enjoy with them in a way that is not common with
grown-up people.&nbsp; I shall never forget how when our dog had
to be killed he seemed to feel the horror of it just as I did,
and how this sense of his really sharing <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>my grief
made him able to comfort me as nobody else could.</p>
<p>He took a transparent pleasure in the honours that came to
him, especially in his membership of foreign Academies, in which
he and Sir David Gill had a friendly rivalry or
&ldquo;race,&rdquo; as they called it.&nbsp; I think this
simplicity was one of his chief characteristics, though most
important of all was the great warmth and width of his
affections.&nbsp; He would take endless trouble about his
friends, especially in going to see them if they were lonely or
ill; and he was absolutely faithful and generous in his love.</p>

<p>After his mother came to live in Cambridge I believe he hardly
ever missed a day in going to see her, even though he might only
be able to stay a few minutes.&nbsp; She lived at some distance
off, and he was often both busy and tired.&nbsp; This constancy
was very characteristic.&nbsp; It was shown once more in his many
visits to Jim Harradine, the marker at the tennis court, on what
proved to be his death-bed.</p>
<p>His energy and his kindness of heart were shown in many cases
of distress.&nbsp; For instance, a guard on the Great Northern
Railway was robbed of his savings by an absconding solicitor, and
George succeeded in collecting some &pound;300 for him.&nbsp; In
later years, when his friend the guard became bedridden, George
often went to see him.&nbsp; Another man whom he befriended was a
one-legged man at Balsham, whom he happened to notice in
bicycling past.&nbsp; He took the trouble to see the village
authorities, and succeeded in sending the man to London to be
fitted with an artificial leg.</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>In these and similar cases there was always the touch
of personal sympathy.&nbsp; For instance, he pensioned the widow
of his gardener, and he often made the payment of her weekly
allowance the excuse for a visit.</p>
<p>In another sort of charity he was equally kindhearted, viz.,
in answering the people who wrote foolish letters to him on
scientific subjects&mdash;and here as in many points he resembled
his father.</p>
<p>His sister, Mrs. Litchfield, has truly said <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a> of George, that he inherited his
father&rsquo;s power of work and much of his &ldquo;cordiality
and warmth of nature, with a characteristic power of helping
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; He resembled his father in another quality,
that of modesty.&nbsp; His friend and pupil, Professor E. W.
Brown, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was always modest about the importance of his
researches.&nbsp; He would often wonder whether the results were
worth the labour they had cost him, and whether he would have
been better employed in some other way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His nephew Bernard, speaking of George&rsquo;s way of taking
pains to be friendly and forthcoming to anyone with whom he came
in contact, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was ready to take other people&rsquo;s
pleasantness and politeness at its apparent value and not to
discount it.&nbsp; If they seemed glad to see him, he believed
that they <i>were</i> glad.&nbsp; If he liked somebody, he
believed that the somebody liked him, and did not worry <!-- page
191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>himself by wondering whether they really did like
him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of his energy we have evidence in the <i>amount</i> of
material contained in his collected works.&nbsp; There was
nothing dilatory about him, and here he again resembled his
father, who had markedly the power of doing things at the right
moment, and thus avoiding waste of time and discomfort to
others.&nbsp; George had none of a characteristic which was
defined in the case of Henry Bradshaw, as &ldquo;always doing
something else.&rdquo;&nbsp; After an interruption he could
instantly reabsorb himself in his work, so that his study was not
kept as a place sacred to peace and quiet.</p>
<p>His wife is my authority for saying that although he got so
much done, it was not by working long hours.&nbsp; Moreover, the
days that he was away from home made large gaps in his
opportunities for steady application.&nbsp; His diaries show in
another way that his researches by no means took all his
time.&nbsp; He made a note of the books he read, and these make a
considerable record.&nbsp; Although he read much good literature
with honest enjoyment, he had not a delicate or subtle literary
judgment.&nbsp; Nor did he care for music.&nbsp; He was
interested in travels, history, and biography, and as he could
remember what he read or heard, his knowledge was wide in many
directions.&nbsp; His linguistic power was characteristic.&nbsp;
He read many European languages.&nbsp; I remember his translating
a long Swedish paper for my father.&nbsp; And he took pleasure in
the Platt Deutsch stories of Fritz Reuter.</p>
<p><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>The discomfort from which he suffered during the
meeting at Cambridge of the International Congress of
Mathematicians in August 1912 was, in fact, the beginning of his
last illness.&nbsp; An exploratory operation showed that he was
suffering from malignant disease.&nbsp; Happily he was spared the
pain that gives its terror to this malady.&nbsp; His nature was,
as we have seen, simple and direct, with a pleasant residue of
the innocence and eagerness of childhood.&nbsp; In the manner of
his death these qualities were ennobled by an admirable and most
unselfish courage.&nbsp; As his vitality ebbed away his affection
only showed the stronger.&nbsp; He wished to live, and he felt
that his power of work and his enjoyment of life were as strong
as ever, but his resignation to the sudden end was complete and
beautiful.&nbsp; He died on December 7, 1912, and was buried at
Trumpington.</p>

WAR MUSIC</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">AN ADDRESS TO A SOCIETY OF MORRIS
DANCERS<br />
DECEMBER 21, 1914</p>
<p>According to the <i>Dictionary of Music</i> <a
name="citation195"></a><a href="#footnote195"
class="citation">[195]</a> the military march is meant &ldquo;not
only to stimulate courage but also to ensure the orderly advance
of troops.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, military music serves to
incite and to regulate movement.&nbsp; But these cannot always be
discriminated.&nbsp; The tramp tramp of marching soldiers is
ordered by the rhythm of the band.&nbsp; This is obvious, but we
cannot say how far the bravery of the tune puts strength into
tired legs, and this would be incitement,&mdash;and how far it is
the unappeasable rhythm that forces the men to keep going, and
this may perhaps be called regulation.&nbsp; There are occasions
when the trumpet comes as a signal to troops waiting to make some
sublime effort, and where the fierce imperious sound has a lift
and a sting which perhaps no pre-concerted signal of a weaker
type could give.&nbsp; This is an example of incitement, but in
as much as it determines the moment of attack it is also a
regulating agent.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Marching is still of importance,&mdash;in spite of the
part taken by railways in modern strategy.&nbsp; I should like to
know whether the magnificent marches of the Russians are made to
the accompaniment of a band or of the regimental choir.&nbsp; One
sees in our volunteer army the tendency to sing on the
march.&nbsp; But it must be allowed that neither words or tunes
are particularly inspiring.&nbsp; The Englishman is habitually
afraid of being solemn, and though his marching songs may contain
good things they are apt to be treated in a light spirit.&nbsp;
There is one which includes the words, &ldquo;Rule, Rule,
Britannia!&rdquo; and &ldquo;God Save the Queen!&rdquo; but these
famous phrases serve as chorus to lighthearted fragments,
<i>e.g.</i> nursery rhymes, such as &ldquo;Little Miss
Muffett.&rdquo;&nbsp; I regret to add that even this classic is
not respectfully used.&nbsp; It should run, &ldquo;There came a
great spider and sat down beside her and frightened Miss Muffett
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I forget the precise words of the parody,
except its ending, &ldquo;And Little Miss Muffett said,
&lsquo;Bother the creature!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I still remember
the fine effect of German soldiers heard many years ago singing
the &ldquo;Wacht am Rhein&rdquo; on the march.&nbsp; Once, too, I
listened to Zouaves, and no greater contrast can be
imagined.&nbsp; It was hardly more than a murmur, a chatter of
diverse scraps, and had no inspiring effect.&nbsp; These
magnificent troops may need no artificial stimulus, but ordinary
folk are certainly kept going by martial music.&nbsp; I remember,
as a boy, marching to the tune of the &ldquo;British
Grenadiers,&rdquo; which has foolish words, and is not striking
from a musical point of view, but it seemed to take us
along.&nbsp; <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>This march-tune comes in finely in
Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s story of the <i>Drums of the Fore and
Aft</i>.&nbsp; An untried British regiment is cut up by Afghans
and retires in a helter-skelter rush, leaving behind two boys of
the Band, who strike up the &ldquo;British Grenadiers&rdquo; with
the solitary squeak of a fife and the despairing roll of a
drum.&nbsp; The answer comes in a great cheer from the
Highlanders and Gurkas waiting on the heights, and in a charge
that turns defeat into victory.&nbsp; I wish that Kipling had
allowed the boys to survive, but the tragedy of their death is
after all the effective close.&nbsp; To return to
marching-tunes.&nbsp; For average people all that is needed is a
well marked rhythm: &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; etc.,
is an admirable march, though taken from its context of tramping
soldiers it is hardly a fine tune.&nbsp; But so far as words are
concerned it must be allowed that the refrain, &ldquo;His soul
goes marching along,&rdquo; is in the right mood for a war
song.</p>
<p>It may be objected that if all I want is rhythm I should be
satisfied with instruments of percussion alone.&nbsp; To this I
reply that the effect of drums is splendidly martial.&nbsp; I was
at Aix at the outbreak of the war, and every day the regiment
quartered there used to march out to the music of drums, and of
bugles which played simple tunes on the common chord.&nbsp; When
the buglers were out of breath, the drums thundered on with
magnificent fire, until once more the simple and spirited fanfare
came in with its brave out-of-doors flavour&mdash;a romantic dash
of the hunting song, and yet with something of the seriousness of
battle.&nbsp; And indeed this is the <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>sort of
melody that suits the dauntless spirit of our allies.&nbsp; As I
watched these men, so soon to fight for their country, I was
reminded of that white-faced boy pictured by Stevenson, striding
over his dead comrades, the roll of his drum leading the living
to victory or death.&nbsp; Drums are said (incorrectly I believe)
to be made of donkey&rsquo;s skin, and Stevenson imagines how,
after death, the poor beast takes this magical revenge for the
blows received in life, by leading cruel man to
destruction.&nbsp; The old English military music seems to have
been played by drums alone.&nbsp; King Charles I issued a warrant
in the following words: <a name="citation198a"></a><a
href="#footnote198a" class="citation">[198a]</a> &ldquo;Whereas .
. . the March of this our nation so famous in all honourable
achievements and glorious warres of this our Kingdom in forraigne
parts was through the negligence and carelessness of drummers . .
. so altered and changed from the ancient gravity and majestic
thereof as it was in danger utterly to have been lost and
forgotten. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; He therefore wills and commands
drummers to play only what is recorded in the curious old
notation of that day.&nbsp; It must be remembered that drums and
trumpets had something of the sacredness of Royalty in the 17th
century.&nbsp; No one was allowed to play them in public without
a license from the Sergeant Trumpeter, <a
name="citation198b"></a><a href="#footnote198b"
class="citation">[198b]</a> an officer who certainly existed a
few years ago, and may, for all I know, still survive.&nbsp; <!--
page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>In the 17th century it was a post of some dignity, and
gave its holder the title of Esquire.</p>
<p>During the great retreat in the winter of 1914 the effect of
music was magnificently illustrated.&nbsp; Mr. Conan Doyle <a
name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a> writes, &ldquo;Exhausted as the troops
were, there could he no halt or rest until they had extricated
themselves from the immediate danger.&nbsp; At the last point of
human endurance they still staggered on through the evening and
the night time, amid roaring thunder and flashing lightning, down
the St. Quentin road.&nbsp; Many fell from fatigue, and having
fallen continued to sleep. . . .&nbsp; In the case of some of the
men the collapse was so complete that it was almost impossible to
get them on.&nbsp; Major Tom Bridges, of the 4th Royal Irish
Dragoons being sent to round up and hurry forward 250 stragglers
at St. Quentin, found them nearly comatose with fatigue.&nbsp;
With quick wit he bought a toy drum, and accompanied by a man
with a penny whistle he fell them in and marched them, laughing
in all their misery, down the high road towards Ham.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When he stopped he found that the men stopped also, so he was
compelled to march and play the whole way to Roupy.</p>
<p>In Sir Henry Newbolt&rsquo;s <i>Song of the Great Retreat</i>
(<i>The Times</i>, Dec. 16, 1914), this triumphant success is
described:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cheerly goes the dark road, cheerly goes
the night,<br />
Cheerly goes the blood to keep the beat:<br />
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Half a thousand dead men marching on to fight,<br />
With a little penny drum to lift their feet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This song ought to be especially interesting to our Society,
because the effect of a small drum and a penny whistle is roughly
the same as that of the pipe and tabor, and these are the
traditional instruments for English Folk Dances.&nbsp; It is
perhaps worth noting that they must in old days have been used in
war, for there is an illustration in an ancient manuscript of a
taborer piping at the head of a body of troops marching out from
a town.</p>
<p>Man is a social animal, and his natural strength lies in
community of action with his fellows.&nbsp; It is this which
gives music its power over masses of men, the pulsation of the
drum, the blare of the answering trumpets, or the strident voice
of the bagpipe cry to them in tones which cannot be
misunderstood, binding them into a brotherhood of courage and
obedience.&nbsp; But a society of Morris Dancers does not need to
be reminded of the noble effect of human movement controlled by
music.&nbsp; The word &lsquo;caper&rsquo; has somewhat ridiculous
associations, but we have learned to respect it for what it
implies: the finely ordered strenuous movement of strong bodies
leaping in rhythmic dance.&nbsp; It suggests something pagan and
prehistoric, a physical religion of astonishing beauty.&nbsp;
Some of our Morris men are now giving all the vigour of their
young bodies to a great and just cause.&nbsp; Let us wish them a
victorious home-coming.</p>

THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE <a name="citation201"></a><a
href="#footnote201" class="citation">[201]</a></h2>
<p>It is not difficult to sympathise with what Dr. Birkbeck aimed
at in founding the College which bears his name.&nbsp; His idea
seems to have been, that whatever a man&rsquo;s calling may be,
he is the better for accurate knowledge of the things with which
he deals.&nbsp; This is a sufficiently obvious statement.&nbsp;
But if for the word &lsquo;accurate&rsquo; we substitute
&lsquo;scientific,&rsquo; it is no longer a platitude&mdash;at
least it is not so in the ears of the semi-educated.&nbsp; For we
can still find people who believe in the &ldquo;practical
man&rdquo; as opposed to one whom they probably call a
scientist.&nbsp; One would like to know more of the conception of
science formed by the unscientific.&nbsp; They are probably
unaware that science is eminently practical in asserting that
only to be true which rests on wide and accurate
generalisation.&nbsp; It is also practical wisdom to hold, as
science does, that truth is temporary and relative, and is in
fact merely the best conclusion that can be drawn in the present
state of knowledge.&nbsp; To many people science is wearisome and
somewhat ridiculous, and these qualities appear in the naturalist
of fiction.&nbsp; Thus when even George Eliot draws a
coleopterist, he is made a feeble old man shuffling to and fro
among his <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>ridiculous beetles.&nbsp; And on the
French stage I have seen a botanist treated in the same
spirit.</p>
<p>Positiveness and bumptiousness are also supposed to be our
attributes.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;New Republic&rsquo; the
characters said to represent Huxley and Clifford are completely
disguised by their pompous pretentiousness.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to describe the ideals of science, but it
is only too easy to fall short of them.&nbsp; It is easy for
instance to become a sectarian, to belong to a school, and to be
literally incapable of fairness towards the opposition.&nbsp;
This was plainly seen at the incoming of evolution, and it was
one of the many glories of Sir Charles Lyell that he could accept
the &lsquo;Origin of Species,&rsquo; and that, in the words of
Hooker, he could under-pin his work with an evolutionary
foundation and find his edifice stronger than ever.&nbsp; But we
need not consider the battles of giants; we are much more likely
to be concerned with the mentally dwarfed or deformed&mdash;with
the dangerous man who makes positive statements on insufficient
data, or suffers from that other vice of not being able to
confess ignorance.&nbsp; The only lectures which impressed me, as
an undergraduate at Cambridge, were those of the late Sir George
Humphry; and his most striking words were confessions of complete
ignorance about many parts of physiology.&nbsp; Here is an
instance of an opposite state of things, of a want of
courage.&nbsp; An eminent chemist was asked why common salt
thrown on the fire gives a blue flame.&nbsp; Now the chemist was
a German, and having been brought up in that land of stoves,
probably had not <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>performed an experiment so easily
made in the home of open fires.&nbsp; So he rashly answered,
&ldquo;It does not burn blue, it is impossible, sodium-salts give
a yellow flame.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this my friend fetched the salt
and threw a handful on to the glowing coals&mdash;with the result
that the eminent chemist rose up and fled in silence from the
room.&nbsp; He gave an admirable example of how not to
behave.&nbsp; He ought not in the first place to have denied the
fact <i>a priori</i>, and when he was convicted he should have
been glad to learn.</p>
<p>It has been said that in scientific work accuracy is the most
valuable quality and the hardest to attain.&nbsp; Accuracy alone
may strike us as a dull quality to be so highly rated.&nbsp; When
a given result has been obtained in eleven successive
experiments, and fails on the twelfth occasion, it is the
accurate-minded man who makes a wise use of the failure.&nbsp; It
ought to arouse in us a flame of curiosity, lighting in us a
whole posse of theories, which force us to vary our procedure and
finally enable us to solve the difficulty.</p>
<p>Most of us are inclined to treat an unexpected result in a
cavalier spirit, pushing it aside as &ldquo;only an
exception,&rdquo; whereas it should be received as possibly a
personage of distinction in disguise, and not as a rude disturber
of our pet ideas.</p>
<p>A class of experimentalists exists from whom we all
suffer&mdash;namely, cooks.&nbsp; How happy we should be if they
possessed this lively desire to understand their own lapses from
good cookery!&nbsp; It may be urged in excuse, that although the
essence of cooking is the application of heat to food, <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>not one cook in a thousand has a thermometer in her
oven.&nbsp; I hope that some of the ladies who have in these
laboratories learned to believe in accuracy, will become
missionaries among the ignorant and insist on this simple
reform.</p>
<p>There is a type of accuracy of a very different kind which may
become an actual vice.&nbsp; For instance, the desire to weigh
things to 1&ndash;10 mg. which should only have been weighed to a
centigram, measuring to 1&ndash;10 mm., and calculating averages
to several places of decimals.&nbsp; In such a science as Botany
this may be positive waste of time.&nbsp; Sachs, the great German
botanist, in whose laboratory I worked, was never tired of
complaining of this &ldquo;sogenannte Genauigkeit,&rdquo; (this
so-called accuracy).&nbsp; I am told that Lord Rayleigh, whose
physical inquiries demand in some cases excessive and minute
accuracy, has a wonderful instinct for knowing when and where he
may relax his methods.</p>
<p>I have been compelled to use the words &lsquo;science&rsquo;
and &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; because these terms have become
firmly adherent to a group of subjects such as Physics,
Chemistry, Geology, Botany, etc., and cannot now be detached from
them.&nbsp; Unfortunately &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; is used in
another sense as implying accuracy of experimental method and in
deduction from results.&nbsp; So that in calling ourselves
scientific men we run the risk of seeming to claim a monopoly of
method, as though we pretended to be somehow superior to the
trained workers in other branches.&nbsp; The current use of the
word seems therefore to cast unjust suspicion on
literature.&nbsp; I wish that <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the word
<i>science</i> could be restored to its original meaning of
knowledge, or the art of knowing; but words (like organisms) are
evolved, and against evolution the gods fight in vain.&nbsp; In
any case I hope it will be believed that in speaking of knowledge
I have taken instances from what is usually called science, not
out of disrespect to literature, but like Dr. Johnson in a
different affair&mdash;from ignorance.</p>
<p>I imagine Dr. Birkbeck to have had no idea that this
institution would be so extensively used for preparing people for
examinations.&nbsp; I doubt whether he would have liked it, but
respect to the pious memory of a founder may be exaggerated, and
since there is no getting rid of examinations, the next best
thing is to make the art of coaching as little harmful as may be
to pupil and teacher.&nbsp; I do not mean to speak slightingly of
coaching as a whole, for a great deal of it is only a very
skilful way of imparting knowledge, but it will be allowed that
some of it is not educative in a broad sense.</p>
<p>You will remember that Mr. Brooke, in <i>Middlemarch</i>, was
in the habit of mildly investigating questions which he always
threw over because he foresaw they would &ldquo;carry him too
far.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess to feeling very like Mr. Brooke when
I attempt to balance the interests of teacher and student.&nbsp;
In that comfortable period, the 18th century, things were all in
favour of the teacher.&nbsp; The poet Gray, who was Professor of
History at Cambridge, could never decide whether to lecture in
Latin or English, and ended by never lecturing at all.</p>
<p>It is now easier to find cases where the teacher <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>is
the victim and slave of his pupils, and has no time or strength
to continue his own education.</p>
<p>This has at least two bad results, and probably more than that
number: (1) From want of time for reading the teacher can hardly
avoid falling behind in a rapidly progressive subject such as one
of the natural sciences, and consequently the University or
College that enslaves him is injuring its own property.&nbsp; (2)
He has no time to do any original work, and this is even worse
for him (and therefore, as before, for the College).&nbsp; He
ceases to be on intimate terms with the plants or animals or
chemical substances with which he has to deal, and his teaching
must necessarily lose that vigour and freshness that comes from
first-hand personal knowledge.&nbsp; It is downright cruelty to
deny time for research to those who vehemently desire to add
something to the fabric of human knowledge.</p>
<p>The hampered teacher reminds me of a certain migratory bird
living with clipped wings in a Zoological Garden: when the
migrating season came round the unfortunate prisoner started to
walk, and was to be seen pressing its breast against the bars at
the north end of its pen.&nbsp; I hope that nowadays all Colleges
realise that they must not prison their birds, but give them the
means of satisfying their natural instinct for fresh and
self-gained knowledge.&nbsp; The students are in one way better
off than their masters, since laboratory work is generally new to
them and has therefore some of the charm of discovery.</p>
<p>In what I have said to-night I have confined myself to Natural
Science, in which alone I have <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>had
experience of teaching or examining.&nbsp; On the literary side
of things I am, I fear, a Philistine, or <i>enfant
terrible</i>.&nbsp; I belong to that class of persons (which has
at least the merit of being very large) who have hardly opened a
Greek or Latin book since the day they passed their
Little-go.</p>
<p>I grudge the time that is given at school to making small boys
groan over books not well suited to them, while French and German
are, or were in my day, all but untaught.&nbsp; If I had had good
oral teaching in modern languages (such, for instance, as that
given at the Perse School in Cambridge) I could forgive my
teachers.&nbsp; We should without tears have learned to talk
fluently and write correctly in at least one modern language, and
for the sake of this I could perhaps have borne the weariness of
Greek and Latin grammar.&nbsp; If it were not for the tyranny of
examinations, classical teaching might be put to its proper use,
which is not to serve as an instrument of torture, but to enable
us to read ancient authors.</p>
<p>I would teach Latin and Greek only to older boys, and by the
method in which we all learn a modern language&mdash;that is when
we have the advantage of being at once teacher and learner.&nbsp;
I mean by reading quickly, with a translation if necessary; at
first without understanding half of what we read, but gradually
picking up words as we go along.&nbsp; This is how I learned to
read easy Italian.&nbsp; By the advice of the late Henry Sidgwick
I began on a bad Italian translation of a French novel, because
such a version, being full of French idioms more or less
literally translated, is <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>easier than
idiomatic Italian.&nbsp; The right book to begin on is a good
murder story, such as one of Gaboriau&rsquo;s, which are
fortunately to be had in bad Italian.&nbsp; What would an old
fashioned teacher of Greek and Latin have said to this!&nbsp; In
my own case I feel that the <i>difficulty</i> of reading the
classics was good discipline, and so far educational.&nbsp; In
Henry Sidgwick&rsquo;s method one is carried along by the
detective business, and learns Italian words as a child picks up
its own language, by context and re-iteration.&nbsp; It will be
said that this method is not applicable to Latin and Greek, and
that even if it were so, it would not be educative.&nbsp; I
confess I do not expect my words to sink into the hearts of the
teachers of what are unkindly called the dead languages.&nbsp;
The great Moloch of examination has constantly to be supplied
with human children, to say nothing of grown-up people.&nbsp;
Some escape, but how many are reduced to ashes?</p>
<p>I have said nothing about what should have been my theme,
namely, the beginning of the College year.&nbsp; To my thinking
beginnings have something of the melancholy that seems more
appropriate to endings.&nbsp; Sad associations tend to adhere to
all that has the quality of periodicity.&nbsp; I for one feel
this when spring once more puts on the familiar look with which
our childhood and youth seemed to mingle on equal terms, but
which upbraids us now we are no longer young.</p>
<p>And in a more work-a-day spirit Monday morning is sad.&nbsp; I
think this is so because the conception Next Week is full of the
ghosts of dead resolutions.&nbsp; No doubt it was on Monday
mornings that Mr. <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Shandy renewed his vow to have the
hinge of the parlour door mended, which I think remained
unrepaired to the end of the book.</p>
<p>But after all, this gloomy point of view belongs to the
onlooker, not to the actors in the rhythm of things.&nbsp; Each
particular Monday is a new-born entity, and doubtless feels a
pleasurable excitement in its brief life.&nbsp; And to the actual
snowdrops and winter aconites that pierce the cold ground, spring
is a new and glorious experience.&nbsp; In this academic
springtime (which chances to occur in autumn) the onlooker need
have no morbid feelings, only perhaps a touch of envy of those
whose College life begins to-day.</p>

PICTURESQUE EXPERIMENTS</h2>
<p>To those who have never made experiments on plants it may seem
that &lsquo;picturesque&rsquo; is an odd term to apply to
laboratory methods.&nbsp; But to an experimentalist the adjective
does not seem overstrained.&nbsp; There is not merely the
pleasure of seeing a prediction verified&mdash;that may be
experienced in more everyday matters.&nbsp; There is a peculiar
delight in the discovery of a method of revealing some detail in
the natural history of living things.&nbsp; I remember vividly
the pleasure which I felt when I first tried the experiment on
<i>Sorghum</i>, described in the essay on the Movements of Plants
in this volume. <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210"
class="citation">[210]</a>&nbsp; I hoped that the seedlings would
curve in the elaborate manner shown in Fig. 4.&nbsp; But I had so
little expectation of success that I did not explain the object
of the trial to my laboratory assistant, and it came as a shock
of delight when he told me that the seedlings had &ldquo;curled
up like corkscrews.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not think that it is an
exaggeration to say, that this result is a picturesque
illustration of the distribution of gravitational sensitiveness
in plants.&nbsp; The instances in the present essay are not
concerned with the movements of plants, and are so far less
interesting, but I think the reader will not refuse them the same
adjective.</p>
<p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>We all know that in plants&mdash;from the smallest weed
to the giant trees of America&mdash;there flows a stream of water
from the root to the topmost leaf.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is an
experience to have ocular proof of this life-giving
current.&nbsp; A branch of laurel is so arranged that it has to
suck up the water it needs through a coarse thermometer tube,
dipping into a beaker.&nbsp; The laurel does not wither, and we
know therefore that it is continuously supplied with water.&nbsp;
If the beaker is removed we shall see the absorption, for the
thermometer tube does not remain full of water; a minute column
of air is seen at its lower end which rapidly increases in size,
and finally when the tube is emptied of its water-content,
bubbles of air escape one after another into the larger tube,
which contains the cut end of the branch.&nbsp; This, the
simplest possible experiment, is nevertheless a vivid ocular
proof of the laurel&rsquo;s power of absorbing water.&nbsp; It
can be shown that the sucking power of the branch depends on its
leaves, for if these are removed the rate of the current is very
greatly diminished.&nbsp; It can also be proved that it depends
on some quality of the leaf surface, for if a new specimen is
taken, and if the lower sides of its leaves are rubbed with
vaseline, the rate of absorption will be seen to diminish very
greatly.&nbsp; Greasing the upper surface of the leaves does not
produce this result, and when we examine the two surfaces it is
found that the lower one is riddled with innumerable microscopic
holes (stomata), while the upper side of the leaf has no such
apertures.&nbsp; The stomata in fact are the arbiters of what
shall pass in or out of the body of the leaf; <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>they are
the gate-keepers who regulate both export and import.&nbsp; They
are known by actual inspection (with a microscope) to close at
night: the result of this is that the evaporation of the leaves
is much slower at night, and this is true when allowance has been
made for the fact that evaporation is also checked at night by
the dampness of the air.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The microscopical inspection of stomata is not a completely
satisfactory method of discovering to what degree they are
open.&nbsp; It has, however, been my good fortune to resuscitate
and simplify a method of studying the stomatal condition.&nbsp;
The method was many years ago tried in a hopelessly cumbersome
form by a German, but never came into use.&nbsp; My apparatus is
described in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society</i>, <a
name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a> and is known as the <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>Porometer.&nbsp; Its essential part is shown in Fig.
7.&nbsp; It consists of a funnel-shaped tube, having a broad
flange, which is cemented on to the stomata-bearing surface of a
leaf.&nbsp; The leaf is represented by the obliquely shaded
object and is enormously magnified.&nbsp; To the upper orifice of
the funnel is fixed a rubber tube, and by means of it steady
suction can be supplied.&nbsp; The result is that a current of
air is drawn through the stomata into the leaf, and then out of
the leaf into the cavity of the porometer.&nbsp; The rate of this
current is an index of the degree to which the stomata are
open.&nbsp; With this apparatus a number of interesting points
can be determined.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Fig. 8 shows the effect of alternate periods of light and
darkness.&nbsp; The fall of the curve represents <!-- page
214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>partial closure, and is seen to occur in the periods of
darkness (black), and to rise when the plant is
re-illumined.&nbsp; These changes are necessarily accompanied by
rise and fall in the evaporation of the leaf, but into the
question of the accuracy of this correlation I shall not
enter.</p>
<p>There are other methods of demonstrating the movements of the
stomata.&nbsp; Stahl had the happy inspiration of making use of
the colour-changes of cobalt chloride.&nbsp; A piece of filter
paper soaked in a 5 p.c. solution of this salt is blue when
dried, and turns pink in damp air.&nbsp; A dry piece of this
material, applied with proper precaution to the stomata-bearing
surface of a leaf, rapidly changes to pink if the stomata are
open.&nbsp; When, however, the same trial is made on the upper
surface of a leaf, where stomata do not occur, no such change
occurs.&nbsp; If two leaves are treated at the same time, one in
the normal position and the other upside down, it is delightful
to watch the appearance of a pink picture of that leaf whose
stomatic surface is in contact with the paper, while no such
change takes place over that which exposes no stomata to the
tell-tale material.&nbsp; Another method was discovered by the
accident of finding in an old house in Wales a Chinese figure of
a man, cut out of a thin shaving of horn, which writhed and
twisted when placed on the hand.&nbsp; It was clearly very
sensitive to moisture, and it seemed possible that horn-shavings
might be used to test the condition of the stomata.&nbsp; The
first difficulty was to obtain a supply of this material.&nbsp;
Having discovered from the P.O. Directory that there were two
<!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>horn-pressers in London I proceeded to visit one of
them somewhere in Hoxton.&nbsp; He turned out to be of a highly
suspicious disposition, but his wife had more discernment, and
persuaded him that I was a harmless customer, with no designs on
trade secrets, and I finally obtained what I wanted.&nbsp; A
delicate strip of horn was fixed to a little block of cork and
placed on a leaf, and to my delight showed the stomata to be open
by violently curving upwards.&nbsp; It was only necessary to fix
a graduated arc to the cork, and to fasten a delicate hair on to
the horn so as to serve as index.&nbsp; The instrument is not of
course accurately quantitative, but it does at least show whether
the stomata are nearly shut, moderately open, or widely so.&nbsp;
Rough as it is I found it good enough for determining a number of
interesting facts in the physiology of stomata. <a
name="citation215a"></a><a href="#footnote215a"
class="citation">[215a]</a></p>
<p>I now pass on to a different subject, the all-important
process on which the life of green plants depends, an act
therefore by which our own existence and that of all other
animals is conditioned.&nbsp; I mean the process known as
<i>assimilation</i>.&nbsp; This is the truly miraculous feat of
using as a source of food the carbonic acid gas (CO2) which
exists in minute quantities in the atmosphere.&nbsp; The plant is
in fact a carbon-catching machine, and the machine is driven by
the energy of the sun, and can therefore only work in
light.&nbsp; The eminent Russian botanist, Timiriazeff, in a
lecture on this subject <a name="citation215b"></a><a
href="#footnote215b" class="citation">[215b]</a> before the Royal
Society, made a witty use of <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s
Travels</i>&mdash;a book not commonly quoted <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>as an
authority in scientific matters.&nbsp; He pointed out that the
philosophers of Lagado, who were extracting sun-beams from
cucumbers, were not doing anything absurd.&nbsp; On the contrary,
since the cucumbers had been built with the help of sunshine, it
was a reasonable expectation that energy corresponding to the
sunshine should be obtainable.&nbsp; This indeed is what we do
when we drive a steam engine by burning coal which ages ago was
built by vegetable machinery driven by sunlight.</p>
<p>It is possible to show the existence of this process by very
simple experiments.&nbsp; The most direct, but the least
interesting, experiment is to take two similar plants, and expose
plant <i>A</i> to an atmosphere containing CO2 while <i>B</i> is
in air freed from that gas.&nbsp; Both specimens are placed in
bright light, and after a sufficient interval of time their
leaves are tested for the presence of starch.&nbsp; This is a
simple matter; the green colouring matter is washed out of them
by means of alcohol, and they are then placed in a dilute
solution of iodine, which has the property of staining starch
purple.&nbsp; It is always pleasant to see the leaf that had been
supplied with CO2 turn blue, while the starved leaf remains a
hungry yellow.</p>
<p>Some of the prettiest methods of demonstrating this process
depend, not on the manufacture of starch in the leaf, but on the
fact that an assimilating plant sets free oxygen, by breaking up
the molecule CO2, building the carbon (C) into its own tissues,
and letting the oxygen (O) go free.&nbsp; A beautiful method was
discovered on these lines by <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Engelmann,
which I was never tired of seeing year after year in my Cambridge
class.&nbsp; Defibrinated bullock&rsquo;s blood is freed from air
by means of an air pump and charged with CO2.&nbsp; In the course
of this process it acquires the dingy tint of venous blood.&nbsp;
A single leaf of the American weed (Elodea) is mounted on a glass
slide in a drop of this blood and covered by an ordinary cover
slip.&nbsp; Then comes the dramatic moment: the preparation is
exposed to sunshine, and in 3 or 4 minutes a delicate scarlet
border begins to appear round the leaf and grows rapidly, making
a curious sunset effect in contrast with dingy purple of the
venous blood.&nbsp; The meaning is very clear; the Elodea leaf in
sunshine took the carbon from the CO2, and the oxygen thus set
free gave the venous blood the scarlet hue characteristic of the
arterial condition.&nbsp; Professor Farmer has designed a
striking method based on another well-known experiment of
Engelmann&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A drop of water containing the products
of decay, and therefore swarming with bacteria, supplies the
test.&nbsp; A drop of this fluid is placed on a glass slip, one
or two delicate leaves of a green water plant (Elodea) are added,
and a square of thin glass is placed on it.&nbsp; Round the edges
of the cover-slip the preparation must be sealed with a
preparation of wax, which melts at a low temperature, and when
cold serves to prevent the preparation drying; it also isolates
it from the surrounding atmosphere.&nbsp; After making sure under
the microscope that the bacteria are in active movement, the
glass slip is placed in the dark for some 3 or 4 hours.&nbsp; It
is then examined, and the bacteria will be found to have <!--
page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>ceased to move because they and the leaves between them
have consumed the oxygen dissolved in the water, and bacterial
activity being dependent on oxygen naturally came to an
end.&nbsp; The preparation is placed under the microscope and
illumined with bright incandescent gas, and after a short time
the bacteria begin to stir and are soon once more whirling in
their insensate dance.&nbsp; The reason is obvious&mdash;the
green leaves under the influence of light were able to seize the
carbon from the CO2, and the O thus set free put the bacteria in
motion.&nbsp; The bacterial dance is therefore evidence of the
act of assimilation carried on by the Elodea leaf.</p>
<p>Yet another method is worth mention, viz., that of
Boussingault.&nbsp; The plant is placed in an inverted glass
vessel resting in a dish of water, and is filled with hydrogen
mixed with a percentage of CO2.&nbsp; Inside the vessel a
fragment of phosphorus is suspended, and as a small amount of
oxygen is sure to be mixed with the hydrogen the phosphorus will
be oxygenated and white fumes will fill the vessel.&nbsp; The
observer must wait until these clouds have subsided, which may
need a couple of hours.&nbsp; This must take place in the dark,
and as soon as the atmosphere is clear, the whole preparation is
placed in bright light, when obvious clouds will again
appear&mdash;a proof that oxygen has been set free by the
assimilation of the green plants.&nbsp; With this example I must
bring my short series of experiments to a close, with the hope
that my readers may not deny that they are picturesque.</p>

DOGS AND DOG LOVERS</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The more I see of men, the more I like
dogs.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Archbishop Whately</span>.
<a name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219"
class="citation">[219]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is it that some people do not like dogs?&nbsp; There are
those who dislike other people&rsquo;s dogs just as they dislike
strange children.&nbsp; This is a point of view which is
comprehensible though unattractive.&nbsp; Still, in comparison
with those who do not like dogs at all this class seem positively
amiable.&nbsp; I knew a lady with the most perfect understanding
of the qualities of human beings, whether bad or good, yet she
had no sympathy with dogs.&nbsp; She would be kind to them, as an
external duty to all living things, but a dog had absolutely no
place in her heart.&nbsp; What made this blindness seem all the
more incomprehensible was the fact that she could love a
bullfinch; she could not therefore plead that she loved humanity
so much that she had no love left for beings of another
sort.&nbsp; After all, it may be that not to care for dogs is no
more a blemish than a lack of musical ear, which is not a sign of
general dullness of artistic perception since it is found in some
poets.&nbsp; We must accordingly allow that not to love dogs is
not a sign of a black heart or <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>a debased
nature.&nbsp; A dog lover will grant this to be an unavoidable
intellectual conclusion, but in the secret corners of his mind he
will feel something more hostile than mere Christian pity for
these emotionally deformed people.&nbsp; If he holds Erewhonian
doctrines he would like to send for the family straightener, and
bear with fortitude the punishment inflicted on his friends and
relations.</p>
<p>I fear that we, the dog lovers, are, by those who do not share
our tastes, held to be unbalanced persons, who intrude their
passions on the reasonable and well bred.&nbsp; They object to us
as victims of perverted instincts, who talk unknown dog-language
in and out of season.&nbsp; It is not clear to me why we care so
much for dogs.&nbsp; Is it, in truth, an exaggeration, or an
offshoot of that love of the helpless young of our own kind which
natural selection develops in social animals?&nbsp; This is not
necessarily maternal, as we see in the story of the heroic male
baboon, who risked his life in saving a young one from a pack of
baying hounds. <a name="citation220a"></a><a href="#footnote220a"
class="citation">[220a]</a>&nbsp; Or is it an instinct developed
in a hunting tribe&mdash;a blind tendency to take good care of
the food-providers (at the expense of starving aunts and
grandmothers), such as we see among the Fuegians, who explained
that, &ldquo;Doggies catch otters&mdash;old women no.&rdquo; <a
name="citation220b"></a><a href="#footnote220b"
class="citation">[220b]</a></p>
<p>However this may be, it is I think certain that the love of
dogs is an unreasoning passion, having all the force of an
instinct.&nbsp; In a story by Miss <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>Wilkins we
see how the love even of a cat may come to be regarded as a human
right or need.&nbsp; The old woman who had lost her cat (he
afterwards emerged half starved from the cellar), rebelled
against the will of God.&nbsp; She allowed that the happiness of
husband and children was possibly not to be expected by everyone,
but &ldquo;there <i>was</i> cats enough to go all
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it impossible to account for the especial affection
that we bear to certain dogs.&nbsp; Dogs are, as I have said, in
a degree like our children; they come to us and they have to be
tended, fed, and guarded, and in these services we learn to love
them.&nbsp; And when our affection is reflected back to us from
the thing we love, it gains an especially touching quality.&nbsp;
In the case of dogs our affection is certainly not a response to
any inherent charm obvious to all the world&mdash;and here again
they resemble children.&nbsp; The dog I loved best was an
inferior Irish terrier, who gave me much trouble and
anxiety.&nbsp; He was constantly fighting; he barked fiercely at
innocent visitors.&nbsp; He killed chickens, and for this I had
to beat him cruelly, tie him up and leave him trembling with a
dead victim round his neck, a punishment for which I still feel
remorse, though it saved him from being shot as a criminal, and
cured him of his murderous tendency for many years.&nbsp; Pat was
not a clever dog, and when striving to learn certain simple
tricks he used to fall into abysses of miserable stupidity, and
give up all hope of winning the biscuit earned by his fellow-dog,
a Scotch terrier, with all the intelligent certainty of his
nation.&nbsp; Pat <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>had one attractive physical quality;
he was perfectly sweet and clean; indeed his adoring family
compared his scent to that of new mown hay; he had also a smooth
head, which was compared, by one enthusiastic admirer, to a
putting-green.&nbsp; He had the attractive and not very common
quality of grinning&mdash;tucking up his lips and showing the
teeth, but producing the effect of a smile, and expressing a shy
and apologetic frame of mind.</p>
<p>Pat lived with a bad tempered Scotch terrier called Whisk,
whom I liked for his strong character and intellectual
acquirements, but I had no great affection for him.&nbsp; He
could not bear being spoken to or even looked at while he ate his
dinner, and would growl with his mouth full, in a terrific
manner, if so disturbed.&nbsp; In the same ferocious spirit he
would growl and snap if his basket was accidentally kicked when
he was dozing in the evening, and however much we apologised he
would take each expression of regret as a fresh insult, and
answer them all with growls, which gradually died away in
sleep.</p>
<p>We only once had a big dog, and he was not a success though he
was an agreeable person.&nbsp; We bought him and his brother, two
very fat mastiff puppies, at North Berwick, and brought them
south.&nbsp; The one pleasant incident in the journey was the
question of a German in Edinburgh station: &ldquo;Madam, who are
these dogs?&rdquo;&nbsp; We gave away one and kept the other, who
bore the magnificent name of Tantallon, soon abbreviated into
Tan.&nbsp; He had many friendly habits, but they were on too
large a scale for domestic life.&nbsp; He had, for instance, <!--
page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>a way of placing a dirty paw on the table cloth at
meals, and he knocked down street children by trying to lick
their faces and (so rumour said) by wagging his tail.&nbsp; He
frightened cab horses into hysterics, and their drivers fell off
and claimed damages.&nbsp; He ate with enjoyment the embroidered
perambulator-cushion of a neighbour, who was discovered looking
on while Tan tore strips off the cushion with that powerful
upward movement of the head and neck which few cushions can
withstand.&nbsp; Finally poor Tan had to be given away, and was
lost sight of.</p>
<p>These rough outlines of the characters of some of our dogs are
meant to show that the reasons for loving dogs are not patent,
and that we cannot complain if the words, used by a little girl
in <i>Punch</i> towards a couple of earwigs, should be applied to
us and our dogs, &ldquo;Nasty creatures!&nbsp; I cannot think how
they can care for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s essay <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a> on <i>The
Character of Dogs</i> is not entirely satisfactory.&nbsp; It is
surely a one-sided view of the dog that &ldquo;he is vainer than
man, singularly greedy of notice, singularly intolerant of
ridicule, suspicious like the deaf, jealous to the degree of
frenzy, and radically devoid of truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is hardly
possible that he should be vainer than man; and in the dog,
vanity is a far simpler and more lovable thing than the complex
and offensive passion in his master.&nbsp; His greed for notice
and his jealousy are part of his great love for his master.&nbsp;
I do not remember that Stevenson ever speaks of <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>the passionate love (not for mankind, but for one
special person) which burns in the heart of a dog.&nbsp; It is a
singular omission&mdash;and I cannot but think it
intentional.&nbsp; If so he was wise, for it certainly does not
lend itself to the manner which Stevenson adopts towards
dogs.&nbsp; No doubt I may be led into sentimentality and general
wearifulness in attempting to describe what seems to me the most
striking characteristic of dogs&mdash;their great and enduring
power of loving.&nbsp; It may be that &ldquo;the day of an
intelligent small dog is passed in the manufacture and laborious
communication of falsehood.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he does not lie when
he says quite plainly how greatly he loves his master.&nbsp; Nor
do I agree that a small spoiled dog would prate interminably, and
still about himself.&nbsp; I think he would say, &ldquo;I love
you&rdquo; rather often, but that bears repetition.&nbsp; I know
a Schipperke whose main interest in life is his dinner, but when
his mistress was ill he had only two desires, to lie on her bed
and to bite the doctor for approaching her.&nbsp; He had to be
dragged out for a walk instead of eagerly begging for one.&nbsp;
Was this an elaborate falsehood?&nbsp; Was it pretence?&nbsp; Was
it conventionality?</p>
<p>A dog can hardly be expected to plead guilty when detected in
crime.&nbsp; He jumps off the forbidden bed when he hears someone
coming, and, being unaware that the warm place on the counterpane
will betray him, he assumes a calm and happy air.&nbsp; But this
is a lie so natural that I for one cannot blame the liar.</p>
<p>In my life with dogs I have felt much more clearly their
desire to speak, and to speak truth, <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>than the
wish to deceive.&nbsp; I had an old Scotch terrier, who in his
youth, before I knew him, had been called Nigel, no doubt because
he was black and small, but as he grew up he somehow acquired the
uncouth name of Scrubbins.&nbsp; At one stage of his career he
was condemned to death for eczema.&nbsp; I begged him off, and he
lived some five years with me, and was cured of his eczema by the
devoted care of a servant.&nbsp; He was a dog of large heart,
who, while he cared for others, was especially devoted to
me.&nbsp; In his old age his eyes became dim and his limbs
stiff.&nbsp; He had a pathetic way of standing staring into my
eyes, or with difficulty getting his paws on to my knees to ask
to have his head rubbed, an attention of which he never
wearied.&nbsp; No one could doubt that this was his expression of
the mutual love that bound us to each other.&nbsp; This was the
indestructible impression produced, and it is useless to tell me
that he may have been striving to conceal some crime, or at least
some base and worldly point of view.&nbsp; When sentiment is
applied to facts, rational conclusions are apt to be
rare&mdash;but without a share of sentiment there might have been
no facts to record.</p>
<p>There are innumerable cases proving the devotion of
dogs&mdash;a passion surviving the master&rsquo;s death, and
prolonged until the dog himself dies.&nbsp; Such is the story of
the heroic dog seen to watch his master&rsquo;s dead body in
South America, keeping the vultures off it, and only allowing
himself an occasional rush to the river for water, until he too
died.&nbsp; What is there here but a passion of love?&nbsp; <!--
page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>We may call it instinct, but what is the love of a
human mother?</p>
<p>A dog differs from his master in not taking offence; you may
tread on his tail and he will only apologise for being in your
way.&nbsp; But I have known a dog bite his mistress when she
interfered with him in a fight, while he was beside himself with
anger.&nbsp; In the same way an unhappy dog caught in a trap may
be so maddened with pain as to attempt to bite those who seek to
free him, but these are extreme cases.&nbsp; It is again part of
this same lovable quality of dogs that they are not given to
moods.&nbsp; They are always ready to welcome us and to wag tails
when we notice them.</p>
<p>M. Anatole France shows in some ways a sympathy with dogs, and
a sensitiveness to their mental attitudes, finer and more true
than anything in Stevenson&rsquo;s essay.&nbsp; The misery of
Riquet <a name="citation226"></a><a href="#footnote226"
class="citation">[226]</a> over the <i>d&eacute;menagement</i> of
his master, M. Bergeret, is admirably drawn.&nbsp; Riquet begins
by barking fiercely when &ldquo;des hommes inconnus, mal
v&ecirc;tus, injurieux et farouches&rdquo; invade his beloved
house, and ends in being lifted in silent misery and shut up in a
portmanteau.&nbsp; Riquet soon becomes too human, but he does at
least show his adoration of M. Bergeret, in mourning over the
desecration and removal of &ldquo;ton fauteuil profond&mdash;le
fauteuil o&ugrave; nous reposions tous les soirs, et bien souvent
le matin, &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; l&rsquo;un de
l&rsquo;autre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. XII. of the <i>Pens&eacute;es de Riquet</i> does not bear
on the love that subsists between dog and man; <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>it goes
deeper however, for it shows that men as well as dogs are
dominated by instinctive night fears which unite them by a most
ancient and enduring bond.&nbsp; Riquet says: &ldquo;&Agrave; la
tomb&eacute;e de la nuit des puissances malfaisantes r&ocirc;dent
autour de la maison,&rdquo; a fact obvious to all children.&nbsp;
There is (No. XII.)an admirable comic prayer to his master
beginning, &ldquo;O mon ma&icirc;tre Bergeret, dieu de carnage,
je t&rsquo;adore.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it seems to me to miss the
true flavour of doggishness.</p>
<p>Professor A. C. Bradley <a name="citation227"></a><a
href="#footnote227" class="citation">[227]</a> strives to show
that Shakespeare &ldquo;did not care for dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
opinion is worthy of respect, and all the more that he seems to
be a dog lover himself.&nbsp; At least, so I interpret what he
says of Shakespeare: &ldquo;To all that he loved most in men he
was blind in dogs, and then we call him universal!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is significant,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the absence
of sympathic allusion to the characteristic virtues of dogs, and
the abundance of allusions of an insulting kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had always imagined that the description of the hounds in
&ldquo;A Midsummer&rsquo;s Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; was written
by one who liked dogs as individuals, not merely as a picturesque
piece of hunting apparatus.&nbsp; But Professor Bradley&rsquo;s
contrary opinion is probably the sounder.&nbsp; In the same way I
think that the passage in &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tray,
Blanche, and Sweetheart,&rdquo; etc., could only have been
written by one who understood the shock which the little
dogs&rsquo; behaviour gave the King.&nbsp; On the other hand, I
agree that Shakespeare does <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>not
sympathise with the admirable conduct of Launce, who sat in the
stocks to save his dog from execution for theft.</p>
<p>Scott was a genuine dog lover.&nbsp; It is on record that he
excused himself for not keeping an engagement on the score of the
death of an old friend, that friend being his bulldog Camp.&nbsp;
His deerhounds Bran and Maida are, like the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s horse Copenhagen, known to all the
world.&nbsp; I am glad to think that Scott&rsquo;s dogs are
preserved in several of his portraits.&nbsp; In his books there
are two types of dogs, Dandie Dinmonts&rsquo; Pepper and Mustard
who have given their master&rsquo;s name to a breed and are real
dogs of flesh and blood.&nbsp; Or again, Harry Bertram&rsquo;s
Wasp, who helps to save Dandie from the thieves.&nbsp; But there
is also the theatrical dog, Roswal, in <i>The Talisman</i>, who
springs at the throat of Conrad of Montserrat and saves his
master&rsquo;s honour.&nbsp; Between these come Gurth&rsquo;s
dog, Fangs, slightly tinged by the &ldquo;tushery&rdquo; of
Ivanhoe, but still striking and pathetic.&nbsp; I keep still my
sympathy with Gurth, who swears &ldquo;by S. Edmund, S. Dunstan,
S. Withold and S. Edward,&rdquo; that he will never forgive
Cedric for having attempted to kill his dog, &ldquo;the only
living creature that ever showed me kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But apart from his love of dogs Scott shows that he can use
them with splendid dramatic effect; for instance, when Dugald
Dalgetty and the Child of the Mist are escaping from the Duke of
Argyll&rsquo;s prison, how we thrill as the distant baying of
those deadly trackers, the bloodhounds, strikes on the ear of the
fugitives.</p>
<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>I am not clear as to what was Dickens&rsquo; personal
attitude towards dogs, but he certainly understood the passion of
the dog lover.</p>
<p>The man who ousted David Copperfield from the box-seat in the
London Coach <a name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a> remarked, &ldquo;&lsquo;Orses and
dorgs is some men&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re wittles and
drink to me&mdash;lodging, wife and children, reading, writing,
and &rsquo;rithmetic&mdash;snuff, tobacker, and
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably we should have felt, as Mr. Pickwick
did on a similar occasion, <a name="citation229b"></a><a
href="#footnote229b" class="citation">[229b]</a> that it would
have been well if horses and dogs had been &lsquo;washing&rsquo;
also.&nbsp; I doubt, in fact, whether we should have enjoyed his
company, or even whether we should have felt him a dog lover of
our own sort&mdash;but we should not be too nice, and must allow
some merit to his form of the passion.</p>
<p>Another of Dickens&rsquo;s characters, Mr. Sleary, <a
name="citation229c"></a><a href="#footnote229c"
class="citation">[229c]</a> of &ldquo;the Horse Riding,&rdquo;
has a much more attractive way of caring for animals.&nbsp; His
theory of how a dog he has lost found him again always pleases
me.&nbsp; The dog is believed to set on foot inquiries among his
friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know a person of
the name of Sleary, do you?&nbsp; Person of the name of Sleary in
the Horse-Riding way&mdash;stout man&mdash;game eye?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The inquiries were successful; and I like, too, the frankly
sentimental account of the appearance of the clown&rsquo;s dog
after his master&rsquo;s death, and the dog&rsquo;s search for
the clown&rsquo;s little girl:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;We was getting up our Children in the Wood one
morning, when there comes into our Ring by the stage door a
dog.&nbsp; He had travelled a long way, he was in very bad
condition, he was lame, and pretty well blind.&nbsp; He went
round to our children, one after another, as if he was a-seeking
for a child he knowd; and then he come to me, and throwed himself
up behind, and stood on his two forelegs, weak as he was, and
then wagged his tail and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I might doubtless give other instances of well-known men who
were lovers of dogs, <a name="citation230a"></a><a
href="#footnote230a" class="citation">[230a]</a> but I shall
refrain from further quotation.&nbsp; The instincts of man are
being purged of the brutality by which they are too often
characterised, and what are clumsily called dumb animals have
benefited side by side with human beings.&nbsp; It is not yet
true that even a merciful man is merciful to his beast, but in
England, at any rate, it is recognised that actual cruelty to
animals is wrong, but even this is not always the case among
other nations.&nbsp; My father used to tell us how, when his
horse was exhausted, he lagged behind his S. American companion
who shouted, &ldquo;Spur him! Don Carlos, spur him! he is
<i>my</i> horse,&rdquo; and simply could not understand my
father&rsquo;s motive.&nbsp; But I am glad to remember that even
among rough people, in uncivilised ages, a sense of humanity to
animals was not unknown.&nbsp; Busbecquius <a
name="citation230b"></a><a href="#footnote230b"
class="citation">[230b]</a> records that in Constantinople an
angry crowd assembled before a shop in which <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>was
exhibited a living bird with its mouth forcibly opened to show
its huge gape.</p>
<p>Cruelty is often said to be the outcome of ignorance and
stupidity rather than of innate brutality.&nbsp; I wish I could
believe this: in any case it is an evil which must be not merely
held in check but rooted out.&nbsp; All lovers of animals owe a
debt of gratitude to the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, not only for their great organisation for the prevention
and punishment of brutalities, but also, and perhaps especially,
for their guidance of public opinion.</p>

another grip; he crooks the little finger and presses against the
lower end of the pipe, of course without occluding the bore at
all.&nbsp; In the early drawings reproduced by Strutt (see

only.&nbsp; This is practically Luca della Robbia&rsquo;s grip,
since the little finger could hardly show in these small
illustrations.&nbsp; In Welch&rsquo;s book on the Recorder (p.

distinction.</p>

four who supported another candidate.&nbsp; None of the electors
are now living.&nbsp; The election occurred in January, and in
June he had the great pleasure and honour of being re-elected to
a Trinity Fellowship.&nbsp; His daughter, Madame Raverat, writes:
&ldquo;Once, when I was walking with my father on the road to
Madingley village, he told me how he had walked there on the
first Sunday he ever was at Cambridge with two or three other
freshmen; and how, when they were about opposite the old chalk
pit, one of them betted him &pound;20 that he (my father) would
never be a professor of Cambridge University: &lsquo;and&rsquo;

the hermitage was leased by the Corporation to Oliver Grene, 20
September, 31 Eliz. [1589].&nbsp; It was in 1790 leased for a
long term to Patrick Beales, from whom it came to his brother, S.
P. Beales, Esq., who erected thereon a substantial mansion and
mercantile premises now occupied by his son, Patrick Beales,
Esq., alderman, who purchased the reversion from the Corporation
in 1839.&rdquo;&nbsp; Silver Street was formerly known as Little
Bridges Street, and the bridges which gave it this name were in
charge of a hermit, hence the above reference to the
hermitage.</p>
<p><a name="footnote173b"></a><a href="#citation173b"

the &ldquo;Big Island,&rdquo; both being leased from the

oblong kitchen garden on the river bank, and bought the freehold
of the Lammas land on the opposite bank of the river.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
